Of all the genres of music I've listened to, none have resonated as strongly with me as post rock has. And when it comes to post rock, there's simply no other band like *Godspeed You! Black Emperor* (aka GY!BE, or, as fans sometimes affectionately call them, God's Pee).

The band was formed in Quebec in 1994 in the genres of post and experimental rock. And they've aged pretty well—you'll find their songs on YouTube, Spotify, the film 28 Days Later, and [in the trailer for the 2018 movie Destroyer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqHaLUoiWZU).

If you've never heard of them, now's a good time to get acquainted with arguably the best post-rock band around. Here's a look at my four favorite GY!BE songs.

## 1. Motherfucker=Redeemer

Black Emperor</a></iframe>

What a title. I have no clue what it means, but I'm fairly certain it's post-rock-speak for "masterpiece." I discovered this gem by accident, all thanks to the hit-or-miss YouTube recommendations. It was a hit.

Though the first minute and a half is somewhat choppy, it builds up to one of the greatest post-rock crescendos that you'll ever hear—there's no missing it once it starts. You can sense some very palpable tension and rage in the chords, a common theme in Yanqui U.X.O. The band [describes the album](https://godspeedyoublackemperor.bandcamp.com/album/yanqui-u-x-o) as "just raw, angry, dissonant, epic instrumental rock."

And then it slowly dies off about ten minutes in. What follows resembles grief and pain. People say this section is so beautiful that it's made them cry; you really do have to hear it for yourself to understand what they mean. Throughout those sorrowful notes are scattered glimpses of hope—a gradually increasing intensity that struggles to fully realize itself. The riffs beginning at 13:50 are particularly amazing.

The final chapter of the song—beginning at around the 23-minute mark—is true redemption, the peak crescendo, and can only be fully enjoyed by barreling down an empty freeway at max speed. As you arrive at 28:40, you find yourself raising the volume to deafening levels. It doesn't get more intense than these last few minutes—and when it's over, you'll feel a wave of relief wash over you. It's an emotional rollercoaster well worth the ride.

## 2. Rockets Fall on Rocket Falls

Let's just say that when rockets fall on Rocket Falls, you won't want to be there to see it all go down.

Whoever made this video was able to perfectly capture the feeling that this song evokes: that of sitting at the edge of the world and witnessing an awe-inspiring catastrophe much greater than you or me or anything else on this planet: the detonation of a hydrogen bomb. It literally blows you away.

When I close my eyes, I picture this song as the last explosive breaths of a dying universe, or a post-war composition echoing throughout the ruined streets of civilization. GY!BE manages to convey feelings of desolation and destruction without uttering a single syllable.

## 3. We Drift Like Worried Fire

DON&#39;T BEND! ASCEND! by Godspeed You! Black Emperor</a></iframe>

There's one word to describe this entire song: Unstable. You feel happy, then sad. Happy, sad. Then you catch a fleeting glimmer of hope at the 8- and 9-minute marks. And then it's back to sadness, despair, and more of that GY!BE dissonance you simply can't get enough of. The emotions drift like worried fire, a lonely little flame dancing in the wind.

The song in general is great, but there's absolutely nothing that compares to the masterful crescendo that begins at 12:00. It paints a very vivid image of a country frantically mobilizing for war and descending into chaos. I like to think that's what the album art represents—what little remains of the aftermath, at least.

## 4. Storm

Black Emperor</a></iframe>

Having endured all of those depressing themes, you're searching for a light at the end of the post-rock tunnel. And here it is.

There really isn't much to say about Storm except that it's *beautiful*. It's a reassurance that everything's going to be okay—a song of celebration, unity, and hope, and a great one at that.
