Do you ever get tired of running meta decks in Yu-Gi-Oh? If you're not afraid to bruise your ego and are willing to lose to—or, surprisingly, defeat—the meta, then using a non-meta deck may be just what you need to have a little fun. Here are my favorites.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="1. Skull Servants" level=2 %}

{% include picture.html img="king" ext="JPG" alt="The King of the Skull Servants, the boss card of the archetype." shadow=false %}

Ah, good ol' *King of the Meme Servants*. The archetype's boss is a Level 1 monster with ATK equal to 1000x the number of Skull Servants in your grave. It can easily grow to 10k+ ATK, assuming your opponent lives long enough to see it get that high. If you play things smart, you'll get **The Lady in Wight** on the field before declaring an attack, guaranteeing King's safety most of the time:

> Face-up Level 3 or lower Zombie-Type monsters on the field, except "The Lady in Wight", cannot be destroyed by battle and are unaffected by Spell/Trap effects. This card's name becomes "Skull Servant" while it is in the Graveyard.

What used to be a joke deck can actually compete with the meta nowadays. With excellent support cards like Uni Zombie, Shiranui Solitaire, Wightprincess, Wightprince, and Mezuki up your sleeves, you'll find that these spooky-scary skeletons are more than just bare bones. You can easily bring out powerful Synchros like PSY-Framelord Omega, Black Rose Dragon, Beelze, and Trishula. Black Rose is a particularly viable option if its effect doesn't get negated—simply clear the field, resurrect King, and it's game over.

**Wightprincess** was a much-needed addition to the archetype; her effects allow you to not only send Whiteprince to the graveyard whenever she's summoned but to also drastically reduce the ATK/DEF of all enemy monsters to prep for King's attack (or protect you from OTKs).

**Wightmare** is another great support card that can help you summon a banished Lady in Wight to protect King or return one banished Skull Servant or Wightmare to the graveyard. It also counts as another skull, so if you go for the second option, that's +2k attack for King. I recommend running only two of it because it can sometimes clog your hand.

Some people like to combine Skull Servants with Lightsworn, but I don't recommend running a mill version of this deck simply because the archetype already has access to many other options that don't require wasting good spell or trap cards. You'll occasionally end up with a useless hand that has one too many normal Skull Servant monsters, but overall, the deck is very enjoyable.

Of all the support cards that you can throw into this mix, my favorite is the quick-play spell **Mask Change II**:

> Discard 1 card, then target 1 face-up monster you control that has a Level; send it to the Graveyard, also, after that, if it left the field by this effect, Special Summon from your Extra Deck, 1 "Masked HERO" monster with the same Attribute, but a higher Level than, the Attribute/Level the monster had when it was on the field (its original Attribute/Level, if face-down. This Special Summon is treated as a Special Summon with "Mask Change"). You can only activate 1 "Mask Change II" per turn.

This lets you easily bring out **Masked HERO Dark Law** to put a bit more pressure on your opponent, with the added bonus of potentially discarding something like a Mezuki or Wightprince for the cost.

In terms of must-have spells, I recommend running 3x **Burial from a Different Dimension**, 2x **Book of Life**, 2x **Dark Allure**, 1x **One for One**, and standard spells like Raigeki, Dark Hole, Monster Reborn, and Twin Twisters.

Overall, this archetype's solid and very fun to play. You always have something you can do to pressure your opponent. And if they bring out monsters that can't be destroyed by card effects, you can simply run over them with King for an easy win.

*Long live the king.*

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="2. Gravekeeper's" level=2 %}

We're going back with this one—*way* back. Gravekeeper's is [one of the oldest archetypes in Yu-Gi-Oh!](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Gravekeeper%27s). Its entire theme is based around ancient Egypt, particularly the civilization's belief in the afterlife and protection of the deceased. And it's got a nice surprise in store for anyone who likes to abuse the graveyard. No more tampering with the dead—with the field spell **Necrovalley** active, you'll shut down many pesky meta decks:

> All "Gravekeeper's" monsters gain 500 ATK and DEF. Cards in the Graveyard cannot be banished. Negate any card effect that would move a card in the Graveyard to a different place. Negate any card effect that changes Types or Attributes in the Graveyard.

<figure>
    {% include picture.html img="gravekeepers" ext="JPG" alt="Some of the key cards of the Gravekeeper's archetype." %}
    <figcaption>All images assembled from the Yu-Gi-Oh! FANDOM wiki.</figcaption>
</figure>

I used to run a Gravekeeper's deck exclusively back when Shaddoll, Zombie, Burning Abyss, and Lightsworn decks were running rampant. Suffice it to say that people weren't too happy with milling their cards and not getting to activate their effects.

But the archetype is even better now. About a year ago, the fusion spellcaster **Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist** (2000 ATK/DEF) was released, and boy is it good:

> Gains ATK/DEF equal to the combined original Levels of the materials used for its Fusion Summon x 100. While “Necrovalley” is on the field, this card, and any card in your Field Zone, cannot be destroyed by card effects. During your Main Phase: You can activate this effect; during the End Phase of this turn, add 1 “Gravekeeper’s” monster or 1 “Necrovalley” card from your Deck to your hand. You can only this effect of "Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist" once per turn.

This came along with two more support cards, **Gravekeeper's Spiritualist** and **Gravekeeper's Headman**:

<figure>
    {% include picture.html img="gravekeepers-support" ext="JPG" alt="New Gravekeeper's support cards." %}
    <figcaption>All images assembled from the Yu-Gi-Oh! FANDOM wiki.</figcaption>
</figure>


**Gravekeeper's Spiritualist** is arguably the more important of the two since she basically serves as a free Polymerization; I recommend running two of her, as three tends to clog your hand. Be sure to toss in a couple copies of **Super Polymerization** and some generic fusions.

**Gravekeeper's Headman** is mostly situational, so I run only one copy of him; he allows you to resurrect a Gravekeeper's monster while bypassing Necrovalley's effect. So you could potentially resurrect Spiritualist and fusion summon Supernaturalist.

The spell **Royal Tribute** was also recently unlimited, so a great strategy is to run a low-monster variant of Gravekeeper's and toss in three copies of it to completely ruin your opponent's hand. This works especially well with **Card of Demise**.

Talk about reviving the dead—a welcome buff to one of my favorite archetypes!

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="3. Nurse Burn, aka Anti-Cure" level=2 %}

Some people just want to watch the world burn. And this is the deck for them.

The entire strategy revolves around two key cards—**Darklord Nurse Reficule** and **Bad Reaction to Simochi**—that share the same annoying effect:

> Any effect that would make your opponent gain LP inflicts the same amount of damage to them, instead.

<figure>
    {% include picture.html img="nurse-burn" ext="JPG" alt="The main cards in the Nurse Burn strategy: Darklord Nurse Reficule and Bad Reaction to Simochi." %}
    <figcaption>All images assembled from the Yu-Gi-Oh! FANDOM wiki.</figcaption>
</figure>

So, do you enjoy pissing off your opponent by dealing effect damage through "healing" cards? Are you willing to tolerate a barrage of explitives when they realize what you're doing? Then by all means, use this deck.

**Gift Card** is pretty much guaranteed 3k damage. But my favorite trick is using the trap **Tri-and-Guess**:

> If each player has an Extra Deck: Declare 1 Extra Deck monster card type (Fusion, Synchro, or Xyz); both players reveal their Extra Deck, and the player who has more cards of the declared card type gains 3000 Life Points.

Pro tip: Load up your Extra Deck with fusions and declare XYZ like a troll. Unless they're running a full Link setup, you're guaranteed to deal 3k damage. You could keep one XYZ in your Extra Deck just so you end up healing yourself if it turns out that they don't have any.

**The Paths of Destiny** is a bit of a gamble since you might end up taking damage if you flip tails, but it's a guaranteed 2k damage for your opponent as long as you have an anti-cure card on the field.

You can make this deck slightly more consistent by using support cards like **Banishment of the Darklords** and **Condemned Witch** to get Reficule on the field more quickly.

Additionally, even though this is primarily an anti-cure strategy, you can still throw in some burn support cards like these:

{% include picture.html img="burn" ext="JPG" alt="Burn support cards." %}

**Dark Room of Nightmare** deals 300 damage each time your opponent takes damage, which is a nice way to slowly burn them over time. **Chain Energy** requires both players to pay 500 LP each time they want to set/activate cards or effects from their hands, for a bit of added pressure. My personal favorite card, **Dimension Wall**, is like Magic Cylinder but better, since it doesn't target. The other two cards are self-explanatory if you've ever played a burn deck.

If you're crazy and are actually considering running this deck in matches, go ahead and side some copies of **There Can Be Only One** (since the only monster you really need is Darklord Nurse Reficule), **Waking the Dragon**, and any other cheesy traps people are running in this format, like **Trickstar Reincarnation**.

Admittedly, this deck doesn't always work well. But when it does, you'll have some good laughs.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="4. Blackwings" level=2 %}

Blackwings are a balanced and consistent archetype, making them a good option for a non-meta deck. They have great draw power with spells like **Black Whirlwind** and **Allure of Darkness**. All of the main Blackwing monsters have good summoning potential and synergy. And you even have hand traps like **Blackwing - Kalut the Moon Shadow** to run over bigger foes or keep your monsters alive in battle.

<figure>
    {% include picture.html img="blackwing" ext="JPG" alt="Monsters from the Blackwing archetype." %}
    <figcaption>All images assembled from the Yu-Gi-Oh! FANDOM wiki.</figcaption>
</figure>

With tuners like **Blackwing - Pinaki the Waxing Moon** and **Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwind**, you get access to some high-level synchro plays like Beelze (both variants), Trishula, and Onimaru the Divine Thunder. The archetype's main synchro monsters are also good options and play well with each other.

In terms of the other main monsters, **Blackwing - Kris the Crack of Dawn** is a good beatstick with 1900 ATK and can survive destruction by spells/traps once per turn. Like Bora the Spear, it gives you a guaranteed special summon if you have other Blackwings on the field. **Blackwing - Blizzard the Far North** can help you set up quick synchro plays by resurrecting Blackwings from your graveyard.

If you're looking for a non-meta deck that isn't complete trash, this is one of the better options. It strikes a good balance between flooding the field, drawing more cards, and summoning powerful Synchro monsters without going overboard.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="5. Yosenju" level=2 %}

Next up on the list are the Yosenju, an archetype of beast and beast-warrior WIND monsters inspired by the Kamaitachi of Japanese folklore—the so-called weasel-like "dust devils" that ride the wind wielding sickles and sharp blades.

<figure>
    {% include picture.html img="yosenju" ext="JPG" alt="The key monsters of the Yosenju archetype." %}
    <figcaption>All images assembled from the Yu-Gi-Oh! FANDOM wiki.</figcaption>
</figure>

This archetype focuses on maintaining field control with the following key monsters: **Yosenju Kama 1**, **Yosenju Kama 2**, and... well, unsurprisingly, **Yosenju Kama 3**. All of these are able to chain normal summons one after another to swarm the field, sharing the following side effect at the end of the turn:

> *Once per turn, during the End Phase, if this card was Normal Summoned this turn: Return it to the hand.*

Some other miscellaneous monsters, like **Yosenju Tsujik**, **Yosenju Izna**, and **Yosenju Sabu** provide auxiliary effects to help support the monsters on your field, such as searching your deck for other Yosenju, protecting your Yosenju from your opponent's effects, or giving your monsters an attack boost.

Essentially, you're swarming the field during your turn and then safely bouncing your monsters back to your hand at the end of the turn. And while that may sound fairly risky since you're leaving yourself open to attacks, there are... ways around that. And one of them goes by the name of **Yosenju Oyam**, a level 6 hand trap that helps you stall until it's your turn:

> When an opponent's monster declares a direct attack: You can send 1 "Yosenju" monster from your hand to the Graveyard, except "Yosenju Oyam"; Special Summon this card from your hand. You can only use this effect of "Yosenju Oyam" once per turn. At the start of the Damage Step, if this card battles an opponent's face-up monster: You can make this card's ATK and DEF become equal to the original ATK of the opponent's monster it is battling, until the end of this turn. When this card is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard: You can add 1 "Yosenju" card from your Deck to your hand.

The archetype also supports Pendulums with a scale of 3/5 (but effectively 3/11) thanks to **Yosenju Shinchu L** and **Yosenju Shinchu R**, boasting two boss pendulums: **Mayosenju Daibak** (3000 ATK / 300 DEF) and **Mayosenju Hitot** (2000 ATK / 3000 DEF). 

<figure>

</figure>

The card on the far-right is **Yosenju Misak**, and it packs a punch:

> At the start of the Damage Step, if this card battles a face-up non-WIND monster: You can destroy that monster. When this card is Pendulum Summoned: You can target 1 card your opponent controls; destroy it. During the End Phase, if this card was Special Summoned this turn: Return it to the hand.

Finally, the Yosenju boast several powerful support spells and traps:

<figure>
    {% include picture.html img="yosenju-support" ext="JPG" alt="Yosenju support spells and traps." %}
    <figcaption>All images assembled from the Yu-Gi-Oh! FANDOM wiki.</figcaption>
</figure>

Left to right, those are:

- **Yosen Training Grounds** (Spell)
- **Yosen Whirlwind** (Spell)
- **Spring of Rebirth** (Spell)
- **Yosenjus' Secret Move** (Counter Trap)
- **Yosenjus' Sword Sting** (Trap)

Since the Yosenju are all WIND monsters, you'll find great synergy with the **Mist Valley** archetype. Moreover, you may want to try your hand at using them in an anti-meta deck, with cards like **Gravekeeper's Commandant** and **Necrovalley** since few, if any, of your cards rely on summons or banishes from the Graveyard.

Overall, this can make for a pretty solid (and annoying) non-meta deck.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="6. God decks" level=2 %}

{% include picture.html img="gods" ext="JPG" alt="Yu-Gi-Oh! god cards: Ra, Obelisk, Slifer, Divine Serpent Geh, and Vennominaga." shadow=false %}

What better way to have fun with your friends than to sacrifice a couple lambs and bring forth powerful deities from your hand? This isn't a single deck so much as it is a class of fun non-meta decks in Yu-Gi-Oh!

Unfortunately, these gods seem more intimidating on paper than they are in reality because of how rapidly the Yu-Gi-Oh! meta has advanced from the "good old days" of the Egyptian god cards and their reign of terror. Nowadays, there are level 4s and Link monsters that are more powerful than those sought-after ancients.

However, this doesn't mean that you still can't run them (or any other god cards) in a deck and have fun, especially with pendulums or beat-stick normals.

In particular, **The Winged Dragon of Ra** has some pretty strong support:

<figure>
    {% include picture.html img="ra" ext="JPG" alt="The Winged Dragon of Ra support cards." shadow=false %}
    <figcaption>All images assembled from the Yu-Gi-Oh! FANDOM wiki.</figcaption>
</figure>

The two cards on the far right deserve some elaboration, as they have not yet (as of this writing) been released. The first is **Reactor Slime**, a level 4 with an effect that directly supports summoning divine beasts like Ra:

> During your Main Phase: You can Special Summon 2 "Slime Tokens" (Aqua/WATER/Level 1/ATK 500/DEF 500), also you cannot Normal or Special Summon monsters for the rest of this turn, except Divine-Beast monsters. During the Battle Phase (Quick Effect): You can Tribute this card; Set 1 "Metal Reflect Slime" directly from your hand, Deck, or GY to your Spell & Trap Zone, also it can be activated this turn. You can only use each effect of "Reactor Slime" once per turn.

The second is the spell card **Ancient Chant**:

> Add 1 "The Winged Dragon of Ra" from your Deck or GY to your hand, and if you do, during your Main Phase this turn, you can Tribute Summon 1 monster, in addition to your Normal Summon/Set. (You can only gain this effect once per turn.) You can banish this card from your GY; if you Tribute Summon "The Winged Dragon of Ra" this turn after you resolved this effect, its original ATK/DEF become the combined original ATK/DEF of the monsters Tributed for its Tribute Summon. You can only activate 1 "Ancient Chant" per turn.

Of course, until these two are released, you'll have to rely on existing support cards like **Ra's Disciple** and **The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode**.

In the meantime, if you're looking for something with more archetypal support, check out the [Aesir archetype](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Aesir), consisting of Nordic-themed cards that work together to summon powerful synchro gods like Odin, Thor, and Loki.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="7. RNG Deck" level=2 %}

I've saved the best (translation: worst) for last.

Fair warning: This deck is essentially a guaranteed L. You will rarely win—but you're sure to have lots of fun if you're up against someone who's willing to relax their game a bit and watch things take their naturally random course.

The goal is simple: Use only cards that include effects like dice rolls, coin flips, and other RNG mechanisms. Can't really complain about RNGesus if you *are* RNGesus, can you?

**Head Judging**:

**Fiend Comedian**:

> Toss a coin and call it. If you call it right, all of your opponent's cards in the Graveyard are removed from play immediately. If you call it wrong, send a number of cards equal to the number of cards in your opponent's Graveyard from your Deck to your Graveyard.

**That Six**:

> Each time a player rolls a die (or dice), you can choose 1 die result, and apply the appropriate effect based on the result.
> ● 1, 3, or 5: The die result is treated as 6.
> ● 2, 4, or 6: The die result is treated as 1.

Meta decks have their place in competitive Yu-Gi-Oh!, but sometimes, all that matters is having fun. These are my favorite non-meta decks to run whenever I'm bored of playing the same old archetypes.

{% include fairUse.html %}
