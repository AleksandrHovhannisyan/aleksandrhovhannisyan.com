Do you ever get tired of running meta decks like Dark World Danger, True Draco, and Salamangreat? If you're not afraid to bruise your ego and are willing to lose to—or, surprisingly, defeat—the meta, then using a non-meta deck may be just what you need to have a little fun. Here are my four personal favorites.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="1. Skull Servants" level=2 %}

{% include posts/picture.html img="king" ext="JPG" alt="The King of the Skull Servants, the boss card of the archetype." %}

Ah, good ol' *King of the Meme Servants*. The archetype's boss is a Level 1 monster with ATK equal to 1000x the number of Skull Servants in your grave. It can easily grow to 10k+ ATK, assuming your opponent lives long enough to see it get that high. If you play things smart, you'll get **The Lady in Wight** on the field before declaring an attack, guaranteeing King's safety most of the time:

> Face-up Level 3 or lower Zombie-Type monsters on the field, except "The Lady in Wight", cannot be destroyed by battle and are unaffected by Spell/Trap effects. This card's name becomes "Skull Servant" while it is in the Graveyard.

What used to be a joke deck can actually compete with the meta nowadays. With excellent support cards like Uni Zombie, Shiranui Solitaire, Wightprincess, Wightprince, and Mezuki up your sleeves, you'll find that these spooky-scary skeletons are more than just bare bones. You can easily bring out powerful Synchros like PSY-Framelord Omega, Black Rose Dragon, Beelze, and Trishula. Black Rose is a particularly viable option if its effect doesn't get negated—simply clear the field, resurrect King, and it's game over.

**Wightprincess** was a much-needed addition to the archetype; her effects allow you to not only send Whiteprince to the graveyard whenever she's summoned but to also drastically reduce the ATK/DEF of all enemy monsters to prep for King's attack (or protect you from OTKs).

**Wightmare** is another great support card that can help you summon a banished Lady in Wight to protect King or return one banished Skull Servant or Wightmare to the graveyard. It also counts as another skull, so if you go for the second option, that's +2k attack for King. I recommend running only two of it because it can sometimes clog your hand.

Some people like to combine Skull Servants with Lightsworn, but I don't recommend running a mill version of this deck simply because the archetype already has access to many other options that don't require wasting good spell or trap cards. You'll occasionally end up with a useless hand that has one too many normal Skull Servant monsters, but overall, the deck is very enjoyable.

Of all the support cards that you can throw into this mix, my favorite is the quick-play spell **Mask Change II**:

> Discard 1 card, then target 1 face-up monster you control that has a Level; send it to the Graveyard, also, after that, if it left the field by this effect, Special Summon from your Extra Deck, 1 "Masked HERO" monster with the same Attribute, but a higher Level than, the Attribute/Level the monster had when it was on the field (its original Attribute/Level, if face-down. This Special Summon is treated as a Special Summon with "Mask Change"). You can only activate 1 "Mask Change II" per turn.

This lets you easily bring out **Masked HERO Dark Law** to put a bit more pressure on your opponent, with the added bonus of potentially discarding something like a Mezuki or Wightprince for the cost.

In terms of must-have spells, I recommend running 3x **Burial from a Different Dimension**, 2x **Book of Life**, 2x **Dark Allure**, 1x **One for One**, and standard spells like Raigeki, Dark Hole, Monster Reborn, and Twin Twisters.

Overall, this archetype's solid and very fun to play. You always have something you can do to pressure your opponent. And if they bring out monsters that can't be destroyed by card effects, you can simply run over them with King for an easy win.

*Long live the king.*

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="2. Gravekeeper's" level=2 %}

We're going back with this one—*way* back. Gravekeeper's is [one of the oldest archetypes in Yu-Gi-Oh!](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Gravekeeper%27s). Its entire theme is based around ancient Egypt, particularly the civilization's belief in the afterlife and protection of the deceased. And it's got a nice surprise in store for anyone who likes to abuse the graveyard. No more tampering with the dead—with the field spell **Necrovalley** active, you'll shut down many pesky meta decks:

> All "Gravekeeper's" monsters gain 500 ATK and DEF. Cards in the Graveyard cannot be banished. Negate any card effect that would move a card in the Graveyard to a different place. Negate any card effect that changes Types or Attributes in the Graveyard.

I used to run a Gravekeeper's deck exclusively back when Shaddoll, Zombie, Burning Abyss, and Lightsworn decks were running rampant. Suffice it to say that people weren't too happy with milling their cards and not getting to activate their effects.

But the archetype is even better now. About a year ago, the fusion spellcaster **Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist** (2000 ATK/DEF) was released, and boy is it good:

> Gains ATK/DEF equal to the combined original Levels of the materials used for its Fusion Summon x 100. While “Necrovalley” is on the field, this card, and any card in your Field Zone, cannot be destroyed by card effects. During your Main Phase: You can activate this effect; during the End Phase of this turn, add 1 “Gravekeeper’s” monster or 1 “Necrovalley” card from your Deck to your hand. You can only this effect of "Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist" once per turn.

This came along with two more support cards, **Gravekeeper's Spiritualist** and **Gravekeeper's Headman**:

**Gravekeeper's Spiritualist** is arguably the more important of the two since she basically serves as a free Polymerization; I recommend running two of her, as three tends to clog your hand. Be sure to toss in a couple copies of **Super Polymerization** and some generic fusions.

**Gravekeeper's Headman** is mostly situational, so I run only one copy of him; he allows you to resurrect a Gravekeeper's monster while bypassing Necrovalley's effect. So you could potentially resurrect Spiritualist and fusion summon Supernaturalist.

The spell **Royal Tribute** was also recently unlimited, so a great strategy is to run a low-monster variant of Gravekeeper's and toss in three copies of it to completely ruin your opponent's hand. This works especially well with **Card of Demise**.

Talk about reviving the dead—a welcome buff to one of my favorite archetypes!

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="3. Nurse Burn, aka Anti-Cure" level=2 %}

Some people just want to watch the world burn. And this is the deck for them.

The entire strategy revolves around two key cards—**Darklord Nurse Reficule** and **Bad Reaction to Simochi**—that share the same annoying effect:

> Any effect that would make your opponent gain LP inflicts the same amount of damage to them, instead.

So, do you enjoy pissing off your opponent by dealing effect damage through "healing" cards? Are you willing to tolerate a barrage of explitives when they realize what you're doing? Then by all means, use this deck.

**Gift Card** is pretty much guaranteed 3k damage. But my favorite trick is using the trap **Tri-and-Guess**:

> If each player has an Extra Deck: Declare 1 Extra Deck monster card type (Fusion, Synchro, or Xyz); both players reveal their Extra Deck, and the player who has more cards of the declared card type gains 3000 Life Points.

Pro tip: Load up your Extra Deck with fusions and declare XYZ like a troll. Unless they're running a full Link setup, you're guaranteed to deal 3k damage. You could keep one XYZ in your Extra Deck just so you end up healing yourself if it turns out that they don't have any.

**The Paths of Destiny** is a bit of a gamble since you might end up taking damage if you flip tails, but it's a guaranteed 2k damage for your opponent as long as you have an anti-cure card on the field.

You can make this deck slightly more consistent by using support cards like **Banishment of the Darklords** and **Condemned Witch** to get Reficule on the field more quickly.

Additionally, even though this is primarily an anti-cure strategy, you can still throw in some burn support cards like these:

{% include posts/picture.html img="burn" ext="JPG" alt="Burn support cards." %}

**Dark Room of Nightmare** deals 300 damage each time your opponent takes damage, which is a nice way to slowly burn them over time. **Chain Energy** requires both players to pay 500 LP each time they want to set/activate cards or effects from their hands, for a bit of added pressure. My personal favorite card, **Dimension Wall**, is like Magic Cylinder but better, since it doesn't target. The other two cards are self-explanatory if you've ever played a burn deck.

If you're crazy and are actually considering running this deck in matches, go ahead and side some copies of **There Can Be Only One** (since the only monster you really need is Darklord Nurse Reficule), **Waking the Dragon**, and any other cheesy traps people are running in this format, like **Trickstar Reincarnation**.

Admittedly, this deck doesn't always work well. But when it does, you'll have some good laughs.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="4. Blackwings" level=2 %}

Blackwings are a balanced and consistent archetype, making them a good option for a non-meta deck. They have great draw power with spells like **Black Whirlwind** and **Allure of Darkness**. All of the main Blackwing monsters have good summoning potential and synergy. And you even have hand traps like **Blackwing - Kalut the Moon Shadow** to run over bigger foes or keep your monsters alive in battle.

With tuners like **Blackwing - Pinaki the Waxing Moon** and **Blackwhing - Gale the Whirlwind**, you get access to some high-level synchro plays like Beelze (both variants), Trishula, and Onimaru the Divine Thunder. The archetype's main synchro monsters are also good options and play well with each other.

In terms of the other main monsters, **Blackwing - Kris the Crack of Dawn** is a good beatstick with 1900 ATK and can survive destruction by spells/traps once per turn. Like Bora the Spear, it gives you a guaranteed special summon if you have other Blackwings on the field. **Blackwing - Blizzard the Far North** can help you set up quick synchro plays by resurrecting Blackwings from your graveyard.

If you're looking for a non-meta deck that isn't complete trash, this is one of the better options. It strikes a good balance between flooding the field, drawing more cards, and summoning powerful Synchro monsters without going overboard.

## Want to Have Fun? Stop Taking Things So Seriously

Meta decks have their place in competitive Yu-Gi-Oh!, but sometimes, all that matters is having fun. These are my favorite non-meta decks to run whenever I'm bored of playing the same old archetypes.
