Gaming is my not-so-guilty pleasure—it provides a nice escape into another world and serves as a creative outlet, a medium that lets me be who I want to be and to do what I want. Here's a look at my favorite video games of all time.

## 1. The Elder Scrolls Skyrim

> *"Let me guess, someone stole your sweetroll?"* — Guards of Skyrim

From [glitching under Whiterun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nnp403XML0) to [trickshotting cabbages into baskets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWl-IHKsKdE), defying gravity on horseback, putting up with Nazeem's condescension, and Fus-Ro-Dah-ing everything off the nearest precipice, Skyrim is one of the most iconic games to date—and easily one of my favorites.

Plus, it brought us the classic "Arrow in the Knee" meme, so we really do have a lot to be thankful for.

Lackluster combat and dead memes aside, Skyrim is an awesome game, DLCs and all. I got it for Chrismas the month after it came out and became wholly absorbed in its lovable world. I made probably over 30 characters and crashed my old Xbox 360 one too many times with all those saves—but it was worth it.

It's also one of the few games that got loading screens right. And they're even better with mods.

## 2. Dark Souls et al.

> *"Hand it over. That thing, your dark soul."* — Slave Knight Gael

It was 2014, and my birthday was approaching. I convinced my mother to hold off on getting me anything just yet because I had my eyes set on a bigger prize: the upcoming release of Dark Souls 2. That would become my first introduction to one of this generation's greatest video game series.

In the summer that followed, I'm part proud and part ashamed to admit that I spent well over 500 hours losing myself in the world of Drangleic. The Dark Souls franchise has a very simple and addictive formula: Thrust the player into a world rife with danger, and let go of their hand. The rush you experience when you finally triumph over a boss that was holding you back for hours is simply euphoric.

When I wasn't playing the game, I was binge-watching [Tears of Grace](https://www.youtube.com/user/TearofGrace) and [MrIwont4get](https://www.youtube.com/user/MrIwont4get) on YouTube, and planning out my next character build. It's not always that you manage to find a game so intoxicating, one that consumes you entirely. Your first Souls experience, regardless of which game gets you hooked, is one that you'll never be able to relive. You'll always be [chasing the dragon](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/04/chasing-the-dragon-with-dark-souls-3/), so to speak, and hoping to reignite that long-extinguished flame with each new installment.

I later went on to play Dark Souls 1 and got to participate in the first [Global Restart Day](https://www.pcgamer.com/today-is-the-dark-souls-global-restart-day/) community event, where a surge of players temporarily revived the co-op experience of Dark Souls by creating new characters. Twinking and jolly cooperation were in full swing, if only for a few months.

Dark Souls 3 was my next purchase a couple years back (yes, I played these three *way* out of order), followed by Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice just a few months ago. Unfortunately, I never got the chance to play Bloodbourne because I've always been an Xbox scrub at heart. If the experience is anything like the descriptions I've heard, it has to be good.

You really can't go wrong with Souls, anyway. And you have the brilliant (err, sadistic?) Hidetaka Miyazaki to thank for it.

## 3. Hollow Knight

> In wilds beyond they speak your name with reverence and regret,
>
> For none could tame our savage souls yet you the challenge met,
>
> Under palest watch, you taught, we changed, base instincts were redeemed,
>
> A world you gave to bug and beast as they had never dreamed.
>
> — *Elegy for Hallownest*

There are many games that seem to be regurgitating the same exact world, themes, gameplay, and story. And then there are games like Hollow Knight that, though they take inspiration from others, manage to craft an entirely unique sensory experience that leaves you in awe.

![TODO TAKE IMAGE]()

Hollow Knight is a masterpiece created by a small team of indie devs known as [Team Cherry](https://teamcherry.com.au). It's a breathtaking game set in a kingdom of bugs that's humming, buzzing, and crawling with adventure.

And you have no idea what it is that you're doing—it's about learning as you go, backtracking to explore previously inaccessible areas, interpreting the lore through whatever bits and pieces you can find, and overcoming great obstacles much harder than that tiny shell on your back.

If Dark Souls and metroidvania games had a baby, Hollow Knight would be it. There's no mistaking the similarities:

- You're attempting to stop an endless cycle, though many others have failed to do so in the past.

- There are [tons of loveable characters](https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/6h6cri/batamas_geo_anybody_have_a_favorite_bugism/) with their own quirks and questlines.

- The bosses are hard as balls. (And as we all know, if a game is hard, [it's basically Dark Souls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPrzobGAyGo).)

- Benches are oddly reminiscent of bonfires, with their warmth, comfort, and soothing music.

- Each new area greets you with beautiful text. You come to a halt to momentarily take it all in.

The soundtrack is also incredibly well done, thanks to award-winning composer Christopher Larkin:

My personal favorites from the Hollow Knight OST are Hornet, Dirtmouth, Resting Grounds, Fungal Wastes, White Palace, and Radiance. It's hard to play favorites, though, because they all have their own charm: Fungal Wastes is bubbling playfully, while Radiance is a grand composition worthy of Hollow Knight's [true final boss battle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2TMWWqzoUQ).

I spent over 50 hours playing Hollow Knight to its end, and words can't express how pumped I am for [Hollow Knight Silksong's release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFAknD_9U7c).

## 4. Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen

> *"This looks interesting."* — literally every single Pawn

## 5. Dishonored

This is one of Bethesda's lesser known games, at least in comparison to the more popular Elder Scrolls and Fallout franchises. But it's definitely worth a play, even if it's a bit dated by today's standards.

Set in a steampunk industrial empire that's engulfed in war and plagued by disease-carrying rats, Dishonored tells the story of legendary Corvo Attano, Lord Protector to the royal family. That title is swiftly taken from Corvo when assassins wielding supernatural powers kill the Empress in his presence, right in front of her daughter, Lady Emily. His hands covered in the dying Empress's blood, Corvo listens to her one parting wish: that he protect Lady Emily from those who would do her harm. Moments later, he's apprehended, wrongfully implicated in the murder by the game's villain, and sent to prison.

You're soon liberated by unknown allies who appear to have an interest in protecting you and Lady Emily, and so begins your quest to avenge the Empress's death and to carry out her wish.

It's a wonderful little game with themes of loyalty, betrayal, and love. It's also one of the few titles where there are direct consequences to your actions. The more you kill, for example, the more hostile and unwelcoming the world becomes as the plague spreads and security is heightened on the streets of Dunwall.

I remember returning from a particular mission to find Lady Emily at one of the tables, drawing a picture of Corvo. If you've been playing the game the way Bethesda intended it to be completed the first time through, you'll be greeted with the portrait of a menacing shadow weilding a bloodstained dagger:

*Is that really what I've become?* Yes, and the guilt trip doesn't stop there. She goes on to innocently utter one of the most chilling lines in the story:

> *Sometimes when you come home, you smell like blood.*

And that's when the game's message clicks: Never lose sight of what's most important. In trying to protect Lady Emily, to avenge her mother's death, and to restore honor to his name, Corvo becomes a monster who murders everyone in his path and sets fire to the world. That has a direct impact on the person that Lady Emily becomes as she matures. If you continue down this path, she'll only follow in your footsteps:

> *What will history tell us? That the daughter of a murdered empress ascended the throne up a mountain of corpses, carried by an assassin named Corvo? No, they'll say that little Emily Kaldwin the First came to power in an age of terror and corruption, and that she did her best in a world that is not kind to little girls, or Empresses. But whether the stories told mention you by name or not, she will remember that you were there, Corvo.*
