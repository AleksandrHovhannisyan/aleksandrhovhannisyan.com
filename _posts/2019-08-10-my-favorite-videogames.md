Gaming is my not-so-guilty pleasure—it provides a nice escape into another world and serves as a creative outlet, a medium that lets me be who I want to be and to do what I want. In no particular order, here are my favorite games of all time.

## 1. The Elder Scrolls Skyrim

> *"Let me guess, someone stole your sweetroll?"* — Guards of Skyrim

From glitching under Whiterun to [trickshotting cabbages into baskets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWl-IHKsKdE), defying gravity on horseback, putting up with Nazeem's condescension, and Fus-Ro-Dah-ing everything off the nearest precipice, you can never really run out of things to do in Skyrim. It's one of the most iconic games to date—and easily one of my favorites.

Plus, it brought us the classic "Arrow in the Knee" meme, so we really do have a lot to thank it for.

Lackluster combat and dead memes aside, Skyrim is an awesome game, DLCs and all. I got it for Chrismas the month after it came out and became wholly absorbed in its fantasy world. I made probably over 30 characters and crashed my old Xbox 360 one too many times with all those saves—but it was worth it.

To this day, Skyrim still feels like it has one of the most fleshed-out worlds—it's clear that lots of attention to detail, creativity, and passion went into crafting it. Here we are, eight years later, and it's still as good as ever, with a very active modding community on PC and a Special Edition release for consoles that's finally allowed us plebs to enjoy Skyrim with mods.

> *"Even now, the amount of people who play Skyrim seven years later—millions of people every month are playing that game.*" — Bethesda's Todd Howard on the success of Skyrim ([2018](https://www.destructoid.com/bethesda-s-todd-howard-on-the-success-of-skyrim-and-its-many-re-releases-511558.phtml)).

It's also one of the few games that got loading screens right—even though they're still quite long, you at least have something to read and in-game models to fiddle with obsessively.

## 2. Dark Souls et al.

> *"Hand it over. That thing, your dark soul."* — Slave Knight Gael

It was 2014, and my birthday was approaching. I convinced my mother to hold off on getting me anything just yet because I had my eyes set on a bigger prize: the upcoming release of Dark Souls 2. That would become my first introduction to one of this generation's greatest video game series.

In the summer that followed, I spent roughly 500 hours losing myself in the world of Drangleic. The Dark Souls franchise has a very simple and addictive formula: Thrust the player into a world rife with danger, and let go of their hand. The rush you experience when you finally triumph over a boss that was holding you back for hours is simply euphoric.

When I wasn't playing the game, I was binge-watching [Tears of Grace](https://www.youtube.com/user/TearofGrace) and [MrIwont4get](https://www.youtube.com/user/MrIwont4get) on YouTube, and planning out my next character build. It's not always that you manage to find a game so intoxicating, one that consumes you entirely.

Your first Souls experience, regardless of which game gets you hooked, is one that you'll never be able to relive. You'll always be [chasing the dragon](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/04/chasing-the-dragon-with-dark-souls-3/), so to speak, and hoping to reignite that long-extinguished flame with each new installment.

I later went on to play Dark Souls 1 and got to participate in the first Global Restart Day community event, where a surge of players temporarily revived the co-op experience of Dark Souls by creating new characters. Twinking and jolly cooperation were in full swing, if only for a few months.

> *You’ll always be chasing the dragon, so to speak, and hoping to reignite that long-extinguished flame with each new installment.*

Dark Souls 3 was my next purchase a couple years back (yes, I played these three *way* out of order), followed by Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice just a few months ago. Unfortunately, I never got the chance to play Bloodbourne because I've always been an Xbox scrub. If the experience is anything like the descriptions I've heard, it has to be good.

Dark Souls is infamous for its difficulty, but veterans know with the classic curve all too well: Difficult and overwhelming at first, but eventually easy once you're familiar with all of the enemies and bosses. This has spawned many daring feats of masochism: no-hit runs, no-bonfire runs, and even... [a banana-only run?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skvcw7bC3so)

You really can't go wrong with Souls games. And you have the brilliant (err, *sadistic*?) Hidetaka Miyazaki to thank for it.

## 3. Hollow Knight

> *You shall seal the blinding light that plagues their dreams. You are the Vessel. You are the Hollow Knight.* — The Pale King

There are many games that seem to be regurgitating the same exact world, themes, gameplay, and story. And then there are games like Hollow Knight that, though they take inspiration from others, manage to craft an entirely unique experience that leaves you in awe.

Hollow Knight is a gorgeous game created by a small team of indie devs known as [Team Cherry](https://teamcherry.com.au), and it takes place in a kingdom of bugs that's humming, buzzing, and crawling with adventure, with you right at the center of everything.

And you have no idea what it is that you're doing—it's about learning as you go, backtracking to explore previously inaccessible areas, interpreting the lore through whatever bits and pieces you can find, and overcoming great obstacles much harder than that tiny shell on your back.

</picture>

If Dark Souls and metroidvania games had a baby, Hollow Knight would be it. There's no mistaking the similarities:

- You're attempting to stop an endless cycle, though many like you have failed to do so in the past.

- There are [tons of loveable characters](https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/6h6cri/batamas_geo_anybody_have_a_favorite_bugism/) with their own quirks and questlines.

- The bosses are hard as balls. (And as we all know, if a game is hard, [it's basically Dark Souls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPrzobGAyGo).)

- Benches are oddly reminiscent of bonfires, with their warmth, comfort, and soothing music.

- Each new area greets you with beautiful text. You pause momentarily to take it all in.

The soundtrack is also incredibly well done, courtesy of award-winning composer Christopher Larkin:

My personal favorites from the Hollow Knight OST are Hornet, Dirtmouth, Resting Grounds, Fungal Wastes, White Palace, and Radiance.

It's hard to play favorites, though, because they all have their own charm: Fungal Wastes is bubbling playfully, while Radiance is a grand composition worthy of Hollow Knight's [true final boss battle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2TMWWqzoUQ).

I spent over 50 hours playing Hollow Knight to its end, and words can't express how pumped I am for [Hollow Knight Silksong's release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFAknD_9U7c).

## 4. Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen

> *"This looks interesting."* — literally every single Pawn

If you've ever played an RPG, especially an action RPG, then you know that few are capable of delivering a truly satisfying combat experience—one that feels weighty and polished.

But that's not the case with Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen, a somewhat underrated Western RPG published by Capcom in 2013. It recently got some [much-needed love](https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-is-getting-the-fresh-chance-it-deserves-o-1834057412) when it was released on the Nintendo Switch, and fans have been eagerly awaiting the rumored Dragons Dogma 2 release for years.

Dragon's Dogma comes with a rather unique hook: Players can summon pawns, or followers, from an online marketplace of characters that other players have created and used as their own pawns. You can have up to three such followers in your party.

    <img src="/assets/img/posts/my-favorite-games/pawns.PNG" alt="The Rift, a shadowy realm in Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen from which the player can enlist Pawns to join their party." />
</picture>

Unlike followers in other games, though, pawns don't remain mute or only respond when you talk to them. Rather, they're constantly interacting with the world, chatting you up on your adventures, helping you to recover when you're out of stamina, and healing the party with consumables.

> *"It hates fire!"* — Thanks... but that's, like, the hundredth time you've said that.

Some players find this annoying, but I actually quite liked it because it made my adventures more entertaining. And even though the pawns are not the most intelligent AI, they certainly do feel more alive than what you may be used to in other games.

In terms of combat, if you're a fan of devastating sorcery, this is the game for you. You can:

- Cast a ritual spell that rain meteors from the sky.
- Spawn tornadoes that melt your enemies' health bars and send lighter foes flying.
- Summon glacial tendrils from your palms that turn enemies to ice.
- Turn your staff into an electric whip.
- Summon walls of fire beneath your foes.
- Envelop enemies in a thick mist of miasma.
- Sync your spellcasting with followers to cast even more powerful spells.

</picture>

What I love most about Dragon's Dogma is that it allows you to respec into any of nine different vocations (classes) without having to start a new character from scratch. This gives you the freedom to enjoy the game's varying playstyles without the tedium of starting a new playthrough. Tired of casting spells? Mix it up—maybe become a Warrior and shatter your foes with greatswords and hammers, or rain arrows from the sky and dance circles around enemies with your daggers as a Strider. It's all up to you—the vocations are [masterworks all](https://twitter.com/DragonsDogma/status/1144672489857069056).

Then, of course, there's the fact that Dragon's Dogma takes melee combat to another level by allowing you to climb large beasts—griffins, chimeras, dragons, you name it. This presents some very unique combat scenarios, like clinging to the wings of a griffin as it soars into the air, or toppling a cyclops by striking its eye.

Dragon's Dogma is a breath of fresh air and makes combat in other action RPGs feel vastly inferior. It's more than worth a play—there's enough content in the main game and DLC to last you for hundreds of hours.

## 5. Dishonored

This is one of Bethesda's lesser known games, at least in comparison to the more popular Elder Scrolls and Fallout franchises. But it's definitely worth checking out, even if it's a bit dated by today's standards.

Set in a steampunk industrial empire that's engulfed in war and plagued by disease-carrying rats, Dishonored tells the story of legendary Corvo Attano, Lord Protector to the royal family. That honorary title is taken from Corvo when the Empress is assassinated in his presence, right in front of her daughter, Lady Emily. Corvo is entrusted with the Empress's one parting wish: that he protect Emily from those who would do her harm. Shortly after, he's apprehended, wrongfully implicated in the murder, and sent to prison.

</figure>

You're soon liberated by unknown allies who appear to have an interest in protecting you and Lady Emily, and so begins your quest to avenge the Empress's death and to carry out her wish.

It's a wonderful game with themes of loyalty, betrayal, and guardianship. It's also one of the few games with tangible consequences to your actions. The more you kill, for example, the more hostile and unwelcoming the world becomes as the plague spreads and security is heightened on the streets of Dunwall.

I remember returning from a particular mission to find Lady Emily drawing a picture of Corvo. If you've been playing the game the way that I believe Bethesda intended it to be completed the first time through, you'll be greeted with the portrait of a menacing shadow wielding a bloodstained dagger:

<figure>

    </picture>

</figure>

She goes on to innocently utter one of the most chilling lines in the story:

> *"Sometimes when you come home, you smell like blood."*

This brief guilt trip is when the game's message hopefully clicks: Never lose sight of what's most important. In trying to protect Lady Emily, to avenge her mother's death, and to restore honor to his name, Corvo becomes a monster who murders everyone in his path and sets fire to the world. That directly influences the person that Lady Emily becomes as she matures. If you continue down this path, she'll only follow in your footsteps:

> *What will history tell us? That the daughter of a murdered empress ascended the throne up a mountain of corpses, carried by an assassin named Corvo? No, they'll say that little Emily Kaldwin the First came to power in an age of terror and corruption, and that she did her best in a world that is not kind to little girls, or Empresses. But whether the stories told mention you by name or not, she will remember that you were there, Corvo.*

It's worth noting that Dishonored doesn't have too much replayability to it; if you do start another playthrough, it will most likely be to get all of the achievements, as well as the different endings. Even so, it's a great game.

## Honorary Mentions

These are games that I either have a love-hate relationship with or that I've stopped playing out of boredom:

- **World of Tanks** (console edition): Tank-on-tank action in teams of 15 players. There's a high skill gap and a lot of grinding to get through, but there's no feeling like blowing the head clean off a tank with a KV-2 and "reliving" the action of World-War-II-era tank combat. Though the game is littered with microtransactions, it's free to play and especially fun with friends.

- **For Honor**: A medieval action game developed by Ubisoft that I still play to this day. What originally began as a game with a very limited roster of heroes now has 25 and counting. Though Ubisoft has supported the game with free expansions and quality-of-life updates, many balance issues have fallen by the wayside. The community also tends to be quite toxic. Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable game that features an innovative combat system.

- **Rainbow Six Siege**: I honestly can't name any *core* problems with Siege as a game, except that I simply grew tired of it. I have very fond memories of it dating back to my early days with the Xbox One, and there's still a decent player base on consoles and PC. But, as with other competitive games, it's had its fair share of toxicity.

And that about does it—I love playing video games and likely always will.
