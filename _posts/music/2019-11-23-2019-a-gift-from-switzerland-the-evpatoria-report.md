You know that feeling when you stumble across a band with a riveting, totally unique sound? It's recommended to you on Spotify, YouTube, or whatever you're listening to these days. Doesn't matter. When the song comes on, you immediately stop what you're doing—because *whatever* it is, and whoever composed it, it demands your attention.

That's how I felt when I first heard The Evpatoria Report, a post-rock band that hails from Switzerland and that published most of its work before 2010. Yet here I am in 2019, engrossed in what are some of the most emotionally moving songs I've ever heard.

Below is a look at some of my favorites from their albums.

This is hands-down my favorite song from The Evpatoria Report.

The soothing intro is pretty typical in post-rock, so don't let it fool you. It's a tease that gradually grows in intensity. And as the crescendo builds, you turn to face the sound. Start bobbing your head. Tapping your feet.

And then the 5:15 bomb drops—so hard, in fact, that I just can't help but picture the whole band lighting on fire as they breathe a violent rage into their instruments. You're overcome with a head-banging, air-drumming fervor.

It's a short-lived high that descends into a long and dreamy melody after about a minute—until, of course, it awakens once more. Except the riffs are new towards the end—still intense, but more hopeful and tame.

All in all, it's a fantastic song.

Down here in Florida, during the summer, the weather's quite nice and pleasant. Intolerably hot at times, sure, but pleasant for the most part.

Occasionally, though, amid all the deceptive calm and sunshine, a rain shower will break loose, *out of nowhere*. And it only lasts a few minutes, stopping as if it had never begun in the first place.

That's how I'd describe the chief crescendo of *Prognoz*—a sudden, violent downpour that momentarily disturbs the peace.

The main chunk of the song is nothing to write home about, but the electric guitar bit at the end is right back to the good stuff.

Wow.

*Have I heard this before?* That's the first thought that crossed my mind when I heard *Dar Now*.

And then, as I closed my eyes, I pictured it clearly: *Stranger Things*—or at least something like it, from that genre of science fiction.

If this doesn't play in Season 4, I'll be legitimately disappointed. No, seriously—the notes are perfect for the show, the setting, the characters, all of it.

The rest of the song? It's decent, but definitely not as good as the intro.

A song beloved by fans of The Evpatoria Report, and often cited as some of the band's best work.

The notes carry the weight of the world—heavy and full of grief—as they play against the backdrop of recordings from the Columbia disaster. It's a beautiful, melancholy composition, a complete 180 from the post-rock I'm used to.

At 2:35, the song reaches in, grabs you by the soul, and shreds you to pieces as the crescendo mounts, just to check if you still have a heartbeat.

> Columbia, Houston, UHF comm check.

The latter half of the song drowns out all noise and paints a remarkably accurate picture of the Columbia shuttle burning up brilliantly upon re-entry, trying to convey with music the anguish that the crew's families must have felt.

Experimental post rock is the name of the game here.

My absolute favorite part begins at 7:55—the guitar riffs are *spectacular*.

The song dies off gently, too, giving you a much-needed respite after so much rock :)

## Thanks, Switzerland

You've spoiled me.

Unfortunately, based on The Evpatoria Report's [most recent Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/theevpatoriareport/), it appears that the band won't be getting back together anytime soon.

But I'll be here, patiently waiting in case they ever do.
