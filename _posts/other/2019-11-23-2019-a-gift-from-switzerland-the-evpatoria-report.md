title: "A Gift from Switzerland: The Evpatoria Report"
description: A review of some great songs from The Evpatoria Report, an arguably underrated Swiss post-rock band.
---

You know that feeling when you stumble across a band with a riveting, totally unique sound? It's recommended to you on Spotify, YouTube, or whatever you're listening to these days. Doesn't matter. When the song comes on, you immediately stop what you're doing—because hell, *whatever* it is, and whoever composed it, it deserves your undivided attention.

You gradually raise the volume as your body catches up with the rhythm. It doesn't even go up high enough.

That's how I felt when I first heard *Eighteen Robins Road* by The Evpatoria Report, a post-rock band that hails from Switzerland and that published most of its work before 2010. Yet here I am in 2019, engrossed in what are some of the most emotionally moving songs I've ever heard.

Below is a look at some of my favorites from their albums.

## Eighteen Robins Road (Maar)

The soothing intro here is pretty typical in post-rock, so don't let it fool you. It's a tease—a buildup for the best that yet awaits. And as the crescendo awakens, so do you. You turn your head. Start bobbing your head. Tapping your feet. Closing your eyes and letting the sound control you.

Make it to 4:30, and the electric riffs become sharper and more poignant as they test the boundaries of the genre. Your whole body's swinging now.

And then the 5:15 bomb drops—so hard, in fact, that I just can't help but picture the whole band lighting on fire as they breathe life into their instruments. You're overcome with a head-banging, air-drumming fervor. The guitars and drums sing your body electric.

It dies down after about a minute and descends into a slow, dreamy melody—until, of course, it awakens once more. Except the riffs are new towards the end—more *tame* and hopeful.

One word sums it all up: explosive.

## Prognoz (Golevka)

Down here in Florida, during the summer, the weather's quite nice and pleasant. Intolerably hot at times, sure, but pleasant for the most part.

Occasionally, though, amid all those god rays, a thunderstorm will break loose, *out of nowhere*. And it only lasts a few minutes, literally stopping as if it had never begun in the first place.

That's how I'd describe *Prognoz*'s chief crescendo. It's a short-lived rain shower that momentarily disturbs the peace.

The rest of the song is nothing to write home about, though—it's not *bad*, but it fails to live up to that amazing intro.

## Dar Now (Maar)

Wow.

*Have I heard this before?* That's the first thought that crossed my mind when I heard *Dar Now*.

And then, as I closed my eyes, I pictured it clearly: *Stranger Things*—or at least something like it, from that genre.

If this doesn't play in Season 4, I'll be legitimately disappointed. No, seriously—the notes are perfect for the show, the setting, the characters, all of it.

The rest of the song? It's decent, but definitely not as good as the intro.

## Taijin Kyofusho (Golevka)

A song beloved by fans of The Evpatoria Report, and often cited as some of the band's best work.

The notes carry the weight of the world—heavy and full of grief—as they play against the backdrop of recordings from the Columbia disaster. It's a beautiful, melancholy composition, a complete 180 from what you'd expect a post-rock band to produce.

At 2:35, the song reaches in, grabs you by the soul, and shreds you to pieces as the crescendo mounts, just to check if you still have a heartbeat.

> Columbia, Houston, comm check.

The latter half of the song drowns out all noise and paints a remarkably accurate picture of the shuttle burning up brilliantly upon re-entry, trying to convey with music the anguish that the Columbia crew's families must have felt.

## Voskhod Project - Bonus (Golevka)

Experimental post rock is the name of the game here. There's really not much else to say!

My absolute favorite part begins at 7:55—the guitar riffs are *spectacular*.

The song dies off smoothly, too, giving you a much-needed respite after so much rock :)

## Thanks, Switzerland

You've spoiled me.

Unfortunately, based on the band's [most recent Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/theevpatoriareport/), it appears that they won't be getting back together anytime soon.

But I'll be here, patiently waiting in case they ever do.
