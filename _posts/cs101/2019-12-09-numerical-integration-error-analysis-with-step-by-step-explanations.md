There's a lot of math coming up. Numerical integration error analysis isn't difficult conceptuallyâ€”the key is to work very slowly to avoid getting lost in the sea of notation.

We'll do error estimates for three Newton-Cotes rules: the Midpoint rule, the Trapezoid rule, and Simpson's rule.

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="Midpoint Rule Error Estimate" level=2 %}

We'd like to estimate the integral of $$f(x)$$ over the interval $$[a, b]$$ using the midpoint, $$m = \frac{a+b}{2}$$.

That is, our goal is to estimate $$I(f) = \int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx$$.

Here's what the midpoint rule looks like graphically:

{% include posts/picture.html img="midpoint" ext="PNG" alt="Numerical integration using the midpoint rule." shadow=false %}

Since we don't know what $$f(x)$$ actually is, we'll approximate the function using a Taylor series expansion centered at $$m$$:

$$f(x) = f(m) + f^{(1)}(m)(x-m) + \frac{f^{(2)}(m)(x-m)^2}{2!} + \frac{f^{(3)}(m)(x-m)^3}{3!} + \frac{f^{(4)}(m)(x-m)^4}{4!}$$

We'll stop here. Let's plug this $$f(x)$$ into $$I(f) = \int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx$$ (and expand the factorials):

$$I(f) = \int_{a}^{b} \Big(f(m) + f^{(1)}(m)(x-m) + \frac{f^{(2)}(m)(x-m)^2}{2} + \frac{f^{(3)}(m)(x-m)^3}{6} + \frac{f^{(4)}(m)(x-m)^4}{24}\Big) dx$$

Let's now take the antiderivative of each piece and evaluate it from $$a$$ to $$b$$:

$$I(f) = f(m)x \Big|_a^b + \frac{f^{(1)}(m)(x-m)^2}{2} \Big|_a^b + \frac{f^{(2)}(m)(x-m)^3}{6} \Big|_a^b + \frac{f^{(3)}(m)(x-m)^4}{24} \Big|_a^b + \frac{f^{(4)}(m)(x-m)^5}{120} \Big|_a^b$$

From here on out, you just have to carefully follow along.

$$I(f) = \Big[(b-a)f(m)\Big] + \Big[\frac{f^{(1)}(m)}{2}\Big((b-m)^2 - (a-m)^2\Big)\Big] + \Big[\frac{f^{(2)}(m)}{6}\Big((b-m)^3 - (a-m)^3\Big)\Big] + \Big[\frac{f^{(3)}(m)}{24}\Big((b-m)^4 - (a-m)^4\Big)\Big] + \Big[\frac{f^{(4)}(m)}{120}\Big((b-m)^5 - (a-m)^5\Big)\Big]$$

Recall that we defined $$m$$ to be $$\frac{a+b}{2}$$. Let's plug this into some of those nested $$b$$ and $$a$$ expressions. You'll see why we do this shortly:

$$I(f) = \Big[(b-a)f(m)\Big] + \Big[\frac{f^{(1)}(m)}{2}\Big((b-\frac{a+b}{2})^2 - (a-\frac{a+b}{2})^2\Big)\Big] + \Big[\frac{f^{(2)}(m)}{6}\Big((b-\frac{a+b}{2})^3 - (a-\frac{a+b}{2})^3\Big)\Big] + \Big[\frac{f^{(3)}(m)}{24}\Big((b-\frac{a+b}{2})^4 - (a-\frac{a+b}{2})^4\Big)\Big] + \Big[\frac{f^{(4)}(m)}{120}\Big((b-\frac{a+b}{2})^5 - (a-\frac{a+b}{2})^5\Big)\Big]$$

Before you panic, consider one such pair of $$a$$ and $$b$$ terms:

$$\Big(b - \frac{a+b}{2}\Big)^2 - \Big(a - \frac{a+b}{2}\Big)^2$$

And let's combine the fractions:

$$\Big(\frac{2b - (a+b)}{2}\Big)^2 - \Big(\frac{2a - (a+b)}{2}\Big)^2$$

And simplify:

$$\Big(\frac{b-a}{2}\Big)^2 - \Big(\frac{a-b}{2}\Big)^2$$

So far so good? Let's plug this back in and repeat the same logic for the rest:

$$I(f) = \Big[(b-a)f(m)\Big] + \Big[\frac{f^{(1)}(m)}{2}\Big((\frac{b-a}{2})^2 - (\frac{a-b}{2})^2\Big)\Big] + \Big[\frac{f^{(2)}(m)}{6}\Big((\frac{b-a}{2})^3 - (\frac{a-b}{2})^3\Big)\Big] + \Big[\frac{f^{(3)}(m)}{24}\Big((\frac{b-a}{2})^4 - (\frac{a-b}{2})^4\Big)\Big] + \Big[\frac{f^{(4)}(m)}{120}\Big((\frac{b-a}{2})^5 - (\frac{a-b}{2})^5\Big)\Big]$$

That may look awful, but the math will simplify quite a bit in a second.

Time for a really useful and simple math trick. Let's take one pair again:

$$\Big(\frac{b-a}{2}\Big)^2 - \Big(\frac{a-b}{2}\Big)^2$$

And let's look at the second term:

$$\Big(\frac{a-b}{2}\Big)^2$$

What can we do to make this look more like the first term? Well, with some simple factoring, we get that this is equal to:

$$\Big(\frac{-1(b-a)}{2}\Big)^2$$

And of course, that power of $$2$$ turns the $$-1$$ into a $$1$$. What does that do for us? ðŸ¤” Let's plug this back in:

$$\Big(\frac{b-a}{2}\Big)^2 - \Big(\frac{b-a}{2}\Big)^2$$

Well, we got the same value as the first term! And what's a value minus itself? Zero!

What about when the power is odd, like $$3$$?

$$\Big(\frac{a-b}{2}\Big)^3 = \Big(\frac{-1(b-a)}{2}\Big)^3 = -\Big(\frac{b-a}{2}\Big)^3$$

Recall that we have pairs that look like this:

$$\Big(\frac{b-a}{2}\Big)^n - \Big(\frac{a-b}{2}\Big)^n$$

If $$n$$ is odd, then substituting the above, we'll get:

$$\Big(\frac{b-a}{2}\Big)^n - \Big(-\Big(\frac{b-a}{2}\Big)^n\Big) = 2\Big(\frac{b-a}{2}\Big)^n$$

> **Key finding**: Wherever we see a term like $$\Big(\frac{b-a}{2}\Big)^n - \Big(\frac{a-b}{2}\Big)^n$$ where $$n$$ is a positive power, we know that the entire expression that it's multiplied with is $$0$$. Whenever $$n$$ is odd, we just get twice the first term!

Let's use this discovery to simplify things:

$$I(f) = \Big[(b-a)f(m)\Big] + 0 + \Big[\frac{f^{(2)}(m)}{6}\Big(2(\frac{b-a}{2})^3\Big)\Big] + 0 + \Big[\frac{f^{(4)}(m)}{120}\Big(2(\frac{b-a}{2})^5\Big)\Big]$$

You've got thisâ€”hang in there! Let's do some simplifying by applying the powers to the scalar denominators:

$$I(f) = \Big[(b-a)f(m)\Big] + \Big[\frac{f^{(2)}(m)}{6}\Big(\frac{2(b-a)^3}{8}\Big)\Big] + \Big[\frac{f^{(4)}(m)}{120}\Big(\frac{2(b-a)^5}{32}\Big)\Big]$$

Now we'll simplify with the $$2$$s in the numerators:

$$I(f) = \Big[(b-a)f(m)\Big] + \Big[\frac{f^{(2)}(m)(b-a)^3}{24}\Big] + \Big[\frac{f^{(4)}(m)(b-a)^5}{1920}\Big]$$

We're almost there! The second trick is to recognize that the very first term is just the midpoint rule:

$$M(f) = (b-a)f(m)$$

So let's substitute that in:

$$I(f) = M(f) + \Big[\frac{f^{(2)}(m)(b-a)^3}{24}\Big] + \Big[\frac{f^{(4)}(m)(b-a)^5}{1920}\Big]$$

And we're essentially done! We usually label those last two terms as error terms. The book I studied with uses $$E(f)$$ and $$F(f)$$ respectively:

$$I(f) = M(f) + E(f) + F(f)$$

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="Trapezoid Rule Error Estimate" level=2 %}

This time, instead of just the midpoint, we have two points for the Trapezoid rule: $$x = a$$ and $$x = b$$. This gives us two equations:

$$f(a) = f(m) + f'(m)(a-m) + \frac{f''(m)(a-m)^2}{2} + \dots$$

$$f(b) = f(m) + f'(m)(b-m) + \frac{f''(m)(b-m)^2}{2} + \dots$$

Now, I'm regrettably going to use the old trick that math teachers love: "If you work it out, you'll get..."

$$I(f) = T(f) - 2E(f) - 4E(f)$$

Where $$E(f)$$ and $$F(f)$$ are the same errors as we got for the midpoint rule. I'm not going to pretend I understand how the integration is performed here. Maybe one day I'll have the patience to work it out by hand ðŸ¤·

{% include linkedHeading.html heading="Simpson's Rule Error Estimate" level=2 %}

We know the following for Simpson's rule:

$$S(f) = \frac{2}{3}M(f) + \frac{1}{3}T(f)$$

And we have these two equations:

$$I(f) = M(f) + E(f) + F(f)$$

$$I(f) = T(f) - 2E(f) - 4E(f)$$

How do we get an error estimate for Simpson's rule? Well, we have an $$M(f)$$ in the first equation and a $$T(f)$$ in the second. Let's rearrange the first equation to solve for $$M(f)$$ and rearrange the second to solve for $$T(f)$$:

$$M(f) = I(f) - E(f) - F(f)$$

$$T(f) = I(f) + 2E(f) + 4E(f)$$

If $$S(f) = \frac{2}{3}M(f) + \frac{1}{3}T(f)$$, then just multiply the first equation by $$\frac{2}{3}$$, the second by $$\frac{1}{3}$$, and then add them together!

$$\frac{2}{3}M(f) = \frac{2}{3}I(f) - \frac{2}{3}E(f) - \frac{2}{3}F(f)$$

$$\frac{1}{3}T(f) = \frac{1}{3}I(f) + \frac{2}{3}E(f) + \frac{4}{3}F(f)$$

Now add these two equations to each other:

$$\frac{2}{3}M(f) + \frac{1}{3}T(f) = S(f) = I(f) + \frac{2}{3}F(f)$$

## That's It!

I hope you found this helpful in understanding how we get numerical integration error estimates.
