## Licensing

This repository is not a template for reuse and has no open-source license, but I'm hosting it publicly as a learning experience. It also [doubles as my comment system](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/static-site-comments-github-issues/). Unless otherwise noted, all rights are reserved (copyright Aleksandr Hovhannisyan 2019â€“Present).

You are *more* than welcome to fork/clone this repo and explore the code. However, you may not redistribute any content that I own in this repo without my permission, unless I've already attributed it to someone else. When in doubt, please feel free to message me and ask!

If you want to reuse just the bare-bones skeleton of this repo, I've created a separate starter that you may find useful: [11ty-sass-images-seo](https://github.com/AleksandrHovhannisyan/11ty-sass-images-seo). It includes sensible defaults and project scaffolding for 11ty, support for Sass, basic image optimization, and various workspace configurations. I've also written [various articles about 11ty](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/tags/11ty/) that you may find useful.

### Third-Party Licensing

I do not own the rights to some open-source resources used on my website (e.g., SVG icons, fonts, etc.). For copies of those licenses, please see the [licenses folder](./licenses/). I've also attributed code that I've borrowed/repurposed with inline comments.

Most social media preview images used in my blog posts are modified or resized versions of Unsplash images that are freely available to use, per the [Unsplash license](https://unsplash.com/license). They are credited accordingly at the end of any article that uses one.
