My personal website and blog, built with 11ty.

## Licensing

This repository is not a template for reuse and has no open-source license. Unless otherwise noted, all rights are reserved (copyright Aleksandr Hovhannisyan 2019â€“Present). However, I'm hosting it publicly as a learning experience; it also [doubles as my comment system](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/static-site-comments-github-issues/). 

You are more than welcome to fork/clone this repo and explore the code. However, you may not redistribute any content that I own in this repo without my permission, unless I've already attributed it to someone else. When in doubt, please feel free to message me and ask. Tutorial code from articles I've written is free to reuse without attribution.

If you want to reuse just the bare-bones skeleton of this repo, I've created a separate starter that you may find useful: [11ty-sass-images-seo](https://github.com/AleksandrHovhannisyan/11ty-sass-images-seo). It includes sensible defaults and project scaffolding for 11ty, support for Sass, basic image optimization, and various workspace configurations. I've also written [several 11ty tutorials](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/tags/11ty/).

### Third-Party Licensing

Most images used for my blog posts' OpenGraph images are modified or resized versions of Unsplash images that are freely available to use, per the [Unsplash license](https://unsplash.com/license). They are credited accordingly at the end of any article that uses one (even though they don't need to be).

All fonts used in this project are licensed under the SIL Open Font License by their respective designers. Since the fonts were not modified and are not being redistributed as standalone projects, copies of their licenses are not included here.

Where appropriate, I've also attributed tutorial code that I've borrowed/repurposed with inline comments. Here are some examples:
