## Licensing

This repository is **not a template for reuse** and has no open-source license, but I'm hosting it publicly as a learning experience and for recruiters. It also doubles as my comment system. Unless otherwise noted for a particular asset/algorithm/etc., all rights are reserved (copyright Aleksandr Hovhannisyan 2019â€“Present). I usually document stuff I've reused from StackOverflow or other sources with inline comments.

Just to be clear: You are *more* than welcome to fork/clone this repo and explore the code. My site also enables source maps for the code if you want to explore it in your dev tools. However, you may not redistribute any content that I own in this repo (e.g., articles, code, etc.) without my permission, unless I've already attributed it to someone else. When in doubt, please feel free to message me and ask!

### Third-Party Licensing

I do not own the rights to some open-source resources used in my website (e.g., SVG icons, fonts, etc.). For copies of those licenses, please see the [LICENSE folder](/src/_licenses/).

Most social media preview images used in my blog posts are modified or resized versions of Unsplash images that are freely available to use, per the [Unsplash license](https://unsplash.com/license). They are credited accordingly at the end of any article that uses one.
