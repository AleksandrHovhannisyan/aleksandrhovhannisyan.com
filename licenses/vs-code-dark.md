## VS Code Dark

Usage (see dark mode variables): https://github.com/AleksandrHovhannisyan/aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blob/master/src/assets/styles/partials/components/_codeBlock.scss#L0-L1

Not sure who the license applies to, but my website's dark mode highlighter theme is not mine. Pretty sure it's GitHub's/Microsoft's and that it's under MIT since it ships with VS Code. I've adapted the colors for use in my syntax highlighter. Feel free to reuse!
