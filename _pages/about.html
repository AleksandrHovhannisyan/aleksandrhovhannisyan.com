  <p>I currently live in Gainesville, Florida, where you'll find plenty of friendly gators, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovebug">lovebugs</a> that'll eat your car's paint, and the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksandr-hovhannisyan-ba154b120/detail/treasury/education:347167463/?entityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profileTreasuryMedia%3A(ACoAAB37EOkBLZYGBFsVU-CrndHmvBk1BNOM32w%2C1580070398462)&section=education%3A347167463&treasuryCount=3">University of Florida</a> (Go Gators!).</p>
  <p>At work, I enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyh3C1xDT3Y">cleaning up spaghetti</a>, creating new features, and getting to know my co-workers.</p>
