  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Thanks for dropping by! My name's Aleksandr—and yes, that's spelled <em>without</em> an <code>e</code> between the
    <code>d</code> and the <code>r</code>, pronounced just like Alexander! Don't worry about pronouncing my last
    name, though, unless you enjoy a good challenge.

    I was originally born in Armenia, a tiny country nestled between Europe, Asia, and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Ararat">a bunch of biblically old mountains</a>. You can
    <em>almost</em> spot it on a world map if you squint hard enough:

    I've lived in the U.S. for over 15 years now, across three states. I currently reside in Gainesville, Florida, where
    you'll find plenty of friendly gators, lovebugs whose carcasses will eat away at your car's paint, the infamous Florida Man, and the

    Professionally, I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for building responsive and accessible user interfaces. I
    enjoy both front-end and back-end work, but I thrive the most in roles that play to my creative strengths and problem-solving skills. At work,
    I enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyh3C1xDT3Y">cleaning up spaghetti</a>, creating new features, polishing UIs, and
    getting to know my co-workers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of work, you'll find me
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp28JPs25ek">praising till I'm hollow</a> and
    <a href="/blog/">writing on this blog</a>. I'm a die-hard
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souls_(series)">Soulsborne</a> fan and love playing video games to relax and
    escape reality \[T]/ I was practically
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhvey_FjtXA">raised by Flash games</a> (may they rest in peace) and an unhealthy amount of Old
    School Runescape, and these experiences have shaped my interests and personality to this day.
  </p>
  <p>Life can get hard at times, but I've always found music to be an incredibly therapeutic and creative outlet. That's why I love listening to these awesome people, either in my free time or while I work:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lana Del Rey</li>
    <li>Arctic Monkeys</li>
    <li>Godspeed You! Black Emperor</li>
    <li>God Is an Astronaut</li>
    <li>Russian Circles</li>
    <li>... and more :)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Basically, I'm <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DSVDcw6iW8">Real Human Bean</a> who enjoys doing
    <em>Real Human Things</em>&trade;.
  </p>
  <p>
    If that sounds like your cup of tea, go ahead and <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a>—I'd love to hear from you!
