  <h1>📖 About Me</h1>
  <p>
    My name's Aleksandr (yes, that's Aleksandr <em>without</em> an <code>e</code> between the <code>d</code> and the
    <code>r</code> 😉). Don't worry about pronouncing my last name, unless you enjoy a good challenge.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was originally born in Armenia, a tiny country nestled between Europe, Asia, and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Ararat">a bunch of biblically old mountains</a>. You can
    <em>almost</em> spot it on a world map if you squint hard enough:

    I've lived in the U.S. for over 15 years now, in three states. I currently reside in Gainesville, Florida, where
    you'll find plenty of friendly gators, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovebug">lovebugs</a> whose carcasses
    will eat away at your car's paint, the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Man">Florida Man</a>,
    and the

    Professionally, I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for building responsive and accessible user interfaces. At
    work, I enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyh3C1xDT3Y">cleaning up spaghetti</a>, creating new
    features, and getting to know my co-workers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of work, you'll find me
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp28JPs25ek">praising till I'm hollow</a> and
    <a href="/blog/">writing on this blog</a>. I'm a die-hard
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souls_(series)">Soulsborne</a> fan and love playing video games to relax and
    escape reality \[T]/
  </p>
  <p>I also like listening to music by these awesome people:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lana Del Rey</li>
    <li>Arctic Monkeys</li>
    <li>Godspeed You! Black Emperor</li>
    <li>God Is an Astronaut</li>
    <li>Russian Circles</li>
    <li>... and more :)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Basically, I'm a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DSVDcw6iW8">Real Human Bean</a> who enjoys doing
    <em>real human things</em>&trade;.
  </p>
  <p>
    If that sounds like your cup of tea, go ahead and <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a>—I'd love to hear from you!
  </p>
  <p>If not... Then, well... <a href="/goodbye" aria-label="Goodbye">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</a></p>
