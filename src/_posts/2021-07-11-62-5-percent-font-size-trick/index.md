  **Update {{ lastUpdated | formatDate: "MM/DD/YYYY" }}**: Originally, this article combined two topics: why you should use rems for font sizing, and how the 62.5% font size trick works. I've now published the former separately: [Use Rems for Font Size to Respect User Preferences](/blog/use-rems-for-font-size/).

Once you get used to thinking in rems, you'll find that it's actually quite easy to express familiar powers of two as fractions of `16`, the root font size of every browser. But if you need to express any other value in rems—like odd numbers or very large numbers—you'll need to do the math by hand, convert it with CSS `calc`, or use a preprocessor like Sass. Alternatively, you can make your life easier using a trick with a root font size of 62.5%.

## Setting the Root Font Size to 62.5%

Many designs and code bases use multiples of two for their spacing and font size scales (usually for convenience and even divisibility). Since `16` happens to be a multiple of two, it's quite straightforward to translate an even pixel value into rems: `8px` is `0.5rem`, `4px` is half that (`0.25rem`), and so on, all the way down to `1px` (`0.125rem`).

Where it gets a little trickier is if you need to use rems to express larger numbers or odd values. For example, `5px` in rems is `0.3125rem`. This isn't *super* difficult to work out by hand, but it's becoming slightly more involved. Instead, it would be nice if we could think in pixels but also reap the benefits of using rems.

Humans are better at thinking in tens since we're familiar with the decimal (base-10) number system. If `1rem` were equal to `10px` in some alternative reality, we could easily translate any pixel amount to rems by dividing it by `10`. So `12px` would be expressed as `1.2rem`, `24px` would be `2.4rem`, and so on. We would no longer need to divide by `16`.

But the root font size of browsers *isn't* `10px`—it's `16px`! So how can we *make* the root font size be `10px`? Well, one way we could do this is by setting the root font size in pixels:

```css
html {
  font-size: 10px;
}
```

**Forget about this approach**—[don't use pixels for font sizing](/blog/use-rems-for-font-size/#dont-use-pixels-for-font-size)! While this does work, it also locks users into a hardcoded root font size of `10px`. If they later change their font size preferences in their browser settings, the root font size on your site won't update. My other article linked above goes into greater detail on why this is such a big deal, but suffice it to say that this is not accessible.

Our only other option is to use percentages (though we could technically also use `em`s). Since `10px` is 62.5% of `16px`, we can set the root font size to be this percentage:

```css
html {
  /* 62.5% of 16px browser font size is 10px */
  font-size: 62.5%;
}

.some-element {
  /* 1.2 * 10px = 12px */
  font-size: 1.2rem;
}
```

If we were to just stop here, the text on our page would be illegibly small at a mere `10px`. We can fix this by setting the font size of our body to be `1.6rem`, which scales us back up to an effective font size of `16px` for all visible text on the page:

```css
html {
  /* 10px */
  font-size: 62.5%;
}

body {
  /* 16px */
  font-size: 1.6rem;
}
```

## Why 62.5% Font Size Works

At this point, you may be a little suspicious. We scaled the root font size down, but then we scaled it back up for the body—doesn't that defeat the whole purpose of scaling the root font size down in the first place?

The important thing to understand is that the root font size (on the `html` element) need not be the same as the font size on the `body` element. In this case, we have a root font size of `10px` because we scaled the `html` font size down to 62.5% of the browser's font size, but we did this solely for the convenience of translating pixels into rems. Our body font size—all of the visible text on the page—is still scaled back up to an effective font size of `16px` so that it matches the browser's font size.

These are just two ways of looking at the same equation. Before, we would've had to perform this calculation to express a target pixel font size in rems:

```
12px in rems: 12 / 16 = 0.75rem
```

But here, we can express `12` as a multiple of `10` without changing the equation:

```
12px in rems: (1.2 × 10) / 16 = 0.75rem
```

We can then group the `10` with the `16` and simplify that fraction:

```
Grouped:     1.2 × (10 / 16) = 0.75rem
Simplified:  1.2 × 0.625 = 0.75rem
```

Notice that the right-hand side of the equation is still the same as it was originally, but the left-hand side expresses the target font size conveniently as a multiple of `10`. This is just a more formal way of arriving at the same result that we derived intuitively.

In short, the 62.5% trick just makes it easier to express pixels in rems.

### Is This Accessible?

So far, we've only considered the case where the browser has the default root font size of `16px`. But what if a user changes their browser's font settings?

Well, recall that we've set the body font size to be `1.6rem`. So we really have this equation:

```
html font size = 62.5% of browser font size (0.625)
body font size = 0.625 × 1.6rem = 1 (i.e., 100% of the browser font size)
```

Notice that we really don't care what the browser font size is. Since `1.6` and `0.625` are inverses of each other, they cancel out in this equation, yielding the browser's font size every time. Our CSS will *always* respect the user's font size preferences.

{% aside %}
I've often seen debates online about the 62.5% font size trick—such as in response to [this contentious tweet from the CSS Tricks account](https://twitter.com/css/status/1523700789083996160). Most of the arguments against it state that you should never change the root font size because it harms accessibility. This *would* be true if we didn't scale the body font size back up to `1.6rem`.
{% endaside %}

#### Example: A User Prefers Larger Font Sizes

Let's look at an example. Assume that we have this CSS:

```css
html {
  font-size: 62.5%;
}
body {
  font-size: 1.6rem;
}
h1 {
  font-size: 4.8rem;
}
```

Now, suppose a user goes into their browser settings and sets their preferred font size to `20px`. Does this create any problems for us? Let's see how the math pans out for body text:

```
Browser font size:  20px
html font size:     0.625 × 20px = 12.5px
body font size:     1.6rem = 1.6 × 12.5px = 20px
```

The body font size equals the browser font size, as expected.

What about the `4.8rem`-sized heading? After the user sets their base font size to `20px`, this heading will have a computed font size of `60px`:

```
Heading font size = 12.5px × 4.8rem = 60px
```

This may seem strange since we actually wanted `4.8rem` to equal `48px`, but remember: That's only true when we assume the root font size is `16px`, which isn't the case here. If a user increases their preferred font size, all `rem`-based font sizes will scale up proportionally. So in this case, it's actually *good* that the heading font size is `60px` because it means that the ratio between the `h1`'s size and the browser font size was preserved:

```
Before: 48px ÷ 16px = 3
After:  60px ÷ 20px = 3
```

## What About `6.25%`?

One thing that's unclear is why `62.5%` was originally chosen for this conversion trick. Sure, it makes the math easier because we now divide by `10` instead of `16` whenever we want to express pixels in rems, but why stop there? For example, we could make `1rem` equivalent to `1px` if we set our root font size to `6.25%`, which is the same as `1/16` (`0.0625`). In that case, we get a one-to-one equivalence between pixels and rems and don't even have to do any math:

```css
html {
  /* 0.0625 * 16px = 1 (i.e., 1rem = 1px) */
  font-size: 6.25%;
}
body {
  /* resolves to 16px */
  font-size: 16rem;
}
h2 {
  /* resolves to 24px */
  font-size: 24rem;
}
h1 {
  /* resolves to 40px */
  font-size: 40rem;
}
```

Some more examples:

```
1rem * 0.0625 = 0.0625rem = 0.0625 * 16 = 1px
2rem * 0.0625 = 0.125rem = 0.125 * 16 = 2px
4rem * 0.0625 = 0.25rem = 0.25 * 16 = 4px
8rem * 0.0625 = 0.5rem = 0.5 * 16 = 8px
```

I haven't tried this out, but I also don't see a reason why it wouldn't work.

## Summary

Rems are great for responsive font sizing, but sometimes you may find the math a little inconvenient if you need to translate odd numbers into rems or work with very large numbers. In that case, you may find it helpful to use the 62.5% font size trick as described in this article since it allows you to think in the familiar base-10 system while using rems.
