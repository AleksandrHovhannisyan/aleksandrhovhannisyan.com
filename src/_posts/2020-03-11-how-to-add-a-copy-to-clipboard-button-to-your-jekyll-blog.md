I'm always looking for ways to improve my site's user experience without toppling the precarious house of cards that is cross-browser compatibility. And one thing that recently drew my attention is the fact that many of my tutorials require copy-pasting code, especially for anything that's not too important to type out by hand (e.g., terminal commands).

You're working with Jekyll, so you're probably using Markdown code blocks like this:

````markdown
Run this command to get started:

```bash
cd my-awesome-project && npm install
```
````

And that works, sure. But copy-pasting this can get tedious really quickly, and it's barely accessible. Why not create a button that magically copies Markdown code blocks to your clipboard?

Well, ask and you shall receive! In this tutorial, we'll add a copy-to-clipboard button to your Jekyll blog in just a few lines of code. Here's a sneak peek at what we'll be building:

<figure>
    {% include img.html img="demo.gif" alt="A demo of clicking a copy-to-clipboard button." %}
    <figcaption>Psst! You can also try this out live on my blog!</figcaption>
</figure>

Note that this tutorial won't introduce any optional CSS or HTML. I'm just going to show you how to get this thing working at a functional level. Once that's taken care of, you can throw in any extra styling or elements that you want.

## Copy-to-Clipboard Button in Jekyll with Liquid and JavaScript

At a high level, all we need is a simple include file that we can stick in front of a Markdown fenced code block to render a copy-to-clipboard button. Then we'll throw in a bit of JavaScript to actually copy the code block to our clipboard. Let's first look at the include file itself:

### 1. Copy-to-Clipboard Include: `_includes/codeHeader.html`

{% include codeHeader.html file="_includes/codeHeader.html" %}
```html
<div class="code-header">
    <button class="copy-code-button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard"></button>
</div>
```

We create a `button` and give it a well-named class. We also add an `aria-label` for screen readers.

And here's how you'd use this include:

{% raw %}
````markdown
{% include codeHeader.html %}
```someLanguage
code goes in here!
```
````
{% endraw %}

This just renders a normal fenced code block (with triple backticks). Right before that, we render the code header, which includes the copy-to-clipboard button.

Below is some CSS to get you started (I'm using SCSS). Styling this to make it look pretty is up to you, so I've omitted colors and font sizes.

{% include codeHeader.html %}
```scss
.code-header {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: flex-end;
}

.copy-code-button {
  display: grid;
  grid-auto-flow: column;
  align-items: center;
  grid-column-gap: 4px;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
  font-size: 1rem;
  padding: 4px 8px;

  &::before {
    content: "Copy";
  }

  &::after {
    content: "üìã";
    display: block;
  }

  // This class will be toggled via JavaScript
  &.copied {
    &::before {
      content: "Copied!";
    }

    &::after {
      content: "‚úîÔ∏è";
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Copying to the Clipboard with JavaScript

All that's left is the JavaScript to copy the code to your clipboard. And that's actually the easy part!

We'll look up two arrays, side by side:

1. All code block headers.
2. All code blocks (which are siblings adjacent to the headers).

Here's the code:

{% include codeHeader.html file="assets/scripts/copyCode.js" %}
```javascript
const codeBlocks = document.querySelectorAll('.code-header + .highlighter-rouge');
const copyCodeButtons = document.querySelectorAll('.copy-code-button');

copyCodeButtons.forEach((copyCodeButton, index) => {
  const code = codeBlocks[index].innerText;

  copyCodeButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    window.navigator.writeText(code);
    copyCodeButton.classList.add('copied');

    setTimeout(() => {
      copyCodeButton.classList.remove('copied');
    }, 2000);
  });
});
```

This uses the `window.navigator.clipboard` API to copy the code block to the clipboard as a string. This API is supported by all modern browsers, so you don't have to use any [textarea hacks](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46822033/5323344).

Note that you may need to replace `.highlighter-rouge` if you're using a different syntax highlighter with Jekyll. It ships with Rouge by default, and `.highlighter-rouge` is the class that gets applied to code blocks.

Finally, the copy-to-clipboard button uses CSS pseudo-elements to show `Copy üìã` in the default state and `Copied! ‚úîÔ∏è` once the `copied` class has been added. This lasts for two seconds and gives the user feedback to indicate that copying to the clipboard went through successfully.

That's it! Don't forget to add a script tag so this code actually works. For example, you can stick this somewhere in your layout file for blog posts:

{% include codeHeader.html file="_layouts/post.html" %}
```html
<script src="/assets/scripts/copyCode.js"></script>
```

## Copy That!

If you've been following along, you should now be all set to use copy-to-clipboard buttons in your Jekyll blog posts. I'll leave it up to you to make the code block header look nicer than what I've presented here. You can also throw in extra logic for things like file names and the language that the code is using.
