I was recently watching a movie about a man who loses everyone he loves. In one key scene, the chief of police was informing the protagonist that they found his brother's body; the camera faced away from the officer and focused on the protagonist, who was visibly in shock and nodded stoically as he tried to process this news. The officer's voice, while audible at first, slowly faded into the background.

What caught my attention in this scene were the subtitles, which I prefer to leave on because I generally find that they help me to concentrate and discern unintelligible dialogue (see Vox's video on [why we all need subtitles now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJtb2YXae8)):

{% quote "Out of the Furnace (2013)", "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1206543/" %}
Officer: A hunter's dog dug him up.

(VOICE FADING SLOWLY) Sorry. They just called me. The coroner's gonna examine the body.

(FAINT) I suspect that you'll have him back by the weekend.

(NO AUDIO)

You could see from the way his head was moving that the officer was still talking—likely offering his condolencese—but the protagonist had already stopped listening. The news was too much to bear.

I knew that subtitles are important for people who have trouble hearing, but I hadn't considered the importance of narrating the _absence_ of sound. It may seem ironic to caption silence for someone who cannot hear, but it actually makes perfect sense: The shift from sound to silence is a deliberate artistic choice, one that nonverbally conveys the character's grief in this scene. If the subtitles didn't capture such a change, then a viewer might misattribute the silence to ther own hearing, especially in a scene such as this one where the speaker is facing away from the camera.

I then thought about how differently a video could be perceived by some viewers if the subtitles never called out other audio cues that we take for granted. A sound as simple as birds chirping in a field. The clatter of silverware and plates at the dinner table. The ominous click of a gun as it's cocked. The familiar creaking of a porch that gives an old home its charm. The distant echoes of children's laughter. These sounds are not essential to a film, but it would be incomplete without them. It would be awfully quiet.
