A while back, [Ari Stathopoulos wrote a tutorial](https://aristath.github.io/blog/static-site-comments-using-github-issues-api) on how to add comments to a Jekyll blog using the GitHub Issues API. And you know what? It works like a charm! Ever since I added comments to my Jekyll blog, I've seen a noticeable increase in engagement from my readers:

{% include img.html img="comments.png" alt="A list of comments on one of my blog posts" %}

That said, this approach isn't without its drawbacks. For one, the GitHub API has a [rate limit of 60 requests/hour](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting). But more importantly, rendering all comments on the initial page load isn't a great user experience.

So, in this tutorial, I'd like to introduce a modified version of Ari's approach that:

1. Only loads the comment system once the user has scrolled to the end of the page.
2. Sanitizes each comment to escape special characters and prevent XSS attacks.
3. Displays relative dates (e.g., `X hours ago`), like you see on most comment systems.

That last point is really optional. My two key concerns were to improve my comment system's performance and to ensure that users can't get away with XSS via GitHub comments.

## How to Add Comments to a Jekyll Blog

This section is a bit of a recap on how to use the GitHub Issues API to add comments to a Jekyll blog. Most of this is covered in Ari's post, save for some differences in the markup itself.

First, you'll need a public repo for your comments. Add this variable to your `_config.yml`:

{% include codeHeader.html file="_config.yml" %}
```yml
issues_repo: YourUsername/RepoName
```

We'll use this a few times in our code, so it's a good idea to define it in one place instead of copy-pasting it. That way, if the repo name ever changes, you'll only have to update it in `_config.yml`.

If a particular blog post needs comments, simply open an issue for it in that repo and note its ID:

{% include img.html img="issue-id.png" alt="The ID of an issue on my GitHub repo." %}

Add the following front matter variable to the blog post and assign it the ID from above:

{% include codeHeader.html file="_posts/2020-07-07-my-post.md" %}
```markdown
comments_id: 35
```

In your `post.html` layout file, we'll check to see if this front matter variable was specified. If it wasn't, then the comment system is turned off for that post. If it was, then we'll want to include a file containing our HTML and JavaScript for the comment system:

{% include codeHeader.html file="_layouts/post.html" %}
{% raw %}
```liquid
{% if page.comments_id %}
    {% include comments.html issue_id=page.comments_id %}
{% endif %}
```
{% endraw %}

And here's the include file itself (or at least part of it—we'll fill in the script shortly):

{% include codeHeader.html file="_includes/comments.html" %}
{% raw %}
```html
{% assign issues_repo = site.issues_repo %}
{% assign issue_id = include.issue_id %}

<section id="comments">
    <div class="comment-actions">
        <h2>Comments <span id="comments-count"></span></h2>
        <a
          class="button solid-button plus-button post-comment-button"
          href="https://github.com/{{ issues_repo }}/issues/{{ issue_id }}"
          >Post comment</a
        >
    </div>
    <div id="comments-wrapper">
      Loading...
    </div>
</section>

<!-- Comments script -->
<script></script>
```
{% endraw %}

Up at the top, I'm simply creating local variables so I don't have to repeat {% raw %}`include.issue_id`{% endraw %} and {% raw %}`site.issues_repo`{% endraw %} in my markup. Next, I've defined some basic HTML for the comment system itself. Notice that the anchor element (button) points to the corresponding GitHub issue URL:

```
{% raw %}https://github.com/{{ issues_repo }}/issues/{{ issue_id }}{% endraw %}
```

When users click this link, they'll be directed to the "comment system" for a given post.

## Using the GitHub Issues API as a Comment System

Time to start writing some JavaScript. We won't put our code in its own `.js` file because we need the include argument in order to hit the right GitHub API endpoint, and that issue ID is only accessible in `_includes/comments.html`. So we'll have to put up with an inline script.

First, we'll create some variables up at the top to reference a few of the elements on the page:

{% include codeHeader.html file="_includes/comments.html" %}
{% raw %}
```html
<script>
  const commentsSection = document.getElementById('comments');
  const commentsWrapper = commentsSection.querySelector('#comments-wrapper');
  const commentsCount = commentsSection.querySelector('#comments-count');
</script>
```
{% endraw %}

We'll want to:

1. Make a request to the GitHub API when a user scrolls to the bottom of a blog post.
2. Load all comment-related dependencies for pre-processing these comments.
3. Once all of those scripts have loaded, render the comments as HTML.

### 1. Detecting When a User Scrolls to the Comments Section

If you simply load the comment system every time a user opens one of your blog posts, that's going to initiate an unnecessary API request and load dependencies that are not yet needed. Getting rid of this unnecessary bandwidth usage becomes especially important for mobile optimization.

To detect when a user has scrolled to the end of our blog post, we'll use the widely supported [IntersectionObserver API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API). Here's all the code that we need to defer loading the comments section:

{% include codeHeader.html file="_includes/comments.html" %}
```javascript
const commentsObserver = new IntersectionObserver(function (entries, self) {
  entries.forEach(entry => {
      if (entry.isIntersecting) {
          fetchComments(); // this is the important part
          self.unobserve(entry.target);
      }
  });
}, { rootMargin: '200px 0px 0px 0px' });

commentsObserver.observe(commentsSection);
```

Basically, the observer checks to see if it's intersecting with the `commentsSection` element. If it is, it calls a `fetchComments` routine that we'll set up in a second. It takes an optional configuration object as its second argument. Here, the config I've passed in sets a `rootMargin` option, which you can think of as a margin around an invisible "intersection rectangle" for the `commentsSection` element's box model. A top margin of `200px` essentially treats an intersection as 200px *before* a user has reached the comments section.

Here's the `fetchComments` function that fires when an intersection occurs:

{% include codeHeader.html file="_includes/comments.html" %}
{% raw %}
```javascript
function fetchComments() {
  fetch(
    'https://api.github.com/repos/{{ issues_repo }}/issues/{{ issue_id }}/comments'
  )
    .then(blob => blob.json())
    .then(initRenderComments)
    .catch(e => {
      commentsWrapper.innerHTML = `<p>Unable to retrieve the comments for this post. Check back later.</p>`;
    });
}
```
{% endraw %}

This uses the `fetch` API. On failure, we set a message informing the user that we were unable to fetch the comments. If the data is returned and processed, we invoke an `initRenderComments` function, which we'll define in a bit. That function begins loading the third-party JavaScript for our comment system.

Speaking of which...

### 2. Loading Dependencies for Our Jekyll Comment System

First, note that we'll need these three scripts for our comment system:

- `marked`, for processing markdown from GitHub comments and spitting out HTML.
- `DOMPurify`, for sanitizing `marked`'s HTML output (e.g., to prevent XSS attacks).
- `Day.js`, for rendering comment timestamps relative to now (e.g., `3 hours ago`).

Now, you could certainly load these dependencies using script elements like so:

```html
<!-- HTML up at the top -->

<script src="https://unpkg.com/marked@0.3.6/marked.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/dompurify@1.0.8/dist/purify.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/dayjs@1.8.21/dayjs.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/dayjs@1.7.8/plugin/relativeTime.js"></script>

<!-- Our custom comments script -->
<script>
  const commentsSection = document.getElementById('comments');
  const commentsWrapper = commentsSection.querySelector('#comments-wrapper');
  const commentsCount = commentsSection.querySelector('#comments-count');

  // more code

</script>
```

**However, I don't recommend doing this** for the same reason that we're deferring our API request until the user scrolls to the bottom of the page: Why fetch resources that we don't need unless a user expects the comments to show up? In other words, we shouldn't just stick these directly in the HTML—we should load them in our JavaScript only after a user has scrolled to the comments section. Better yet, if the GitHub API returns no comments, we won't even bother loading these scripts, saving the user even more bandwidth and making Lighthouse happy.

There are two approaches you can take here to defer loading dependencies, depending on whether you're using a module bundler like Webpack or if you're just using vanilla JS without any bundler. The first approach is the more universal one and doesn't involve Webpack, but it can feel a bit hacky and old-fashioned. The better approach is to install these packages as node modules and use dynamic imports to load them as chunks at run time.

To keep this post accessible to most readers, I'll load these scripts using JavaScript by creating `script` elements, setting their `src` attributes, and appending them to the DOM body. However, since scripts are loaded asynchronously, they may get loaded out of order. This means we'll need some way to hold off on rendering the comments until *all* of the dependencies have loaded, in whatever order that may be. To do that, we'll use a simple object like this to keep track of which dependencies have loaded:

{% include codeHeader.html file="_includes/comments.html" %}
```javascript
const commentScripts = {
  marked: {
    src: 'https://unpkg.com/marked@0.3.6/marked.min.js',
    loaded: false,
  },
  DOMPurify: {
    src: 'https://unpkg.com/dompurify@1.0.8/dist/purify.min.js',
    loaded: false,
  },
  dayjs: {
    src: 'https://unpkg.com/dayjs@1.8.21/dayjs.min.js',
    loaded: false,
  },
  dayJsRelativeTimePlugin: {
    src: 'https://unpkg.com/dayjs@1.7.8/plugin/relativeTime.js',
    loaded: false,
  },
};
```

> Feel free to use a different CDN or serve these files locally if you'd like to.

We'll also define a helper function to go along with it that checks if all scripts have loaded:

{% include codeHeader.html file="_includes/comments.html" %}
{% raw %}
```javascript
/**
* @returns {Boolean} true if all comment dependencies have loaded, and false otherwise
*/
function allCommentScriptsLoaded() {
  return Object.keys(commentScripts).every(script => commentScripts[script].loaded);
}
```
{% endraw %}

> **Note**: Alternatively, you could increment a counter and compare it to the length of the `commentScripts` object. My approach, while not necessarily efficient, is good enough.

Here's the `initRenderComments` function that gets called by `fetchComments` once it finishes:

{% include codeHeader.html file="_includes/comments.html" %}
```javascript
/**
* Called after the GitHub API request finishes.
* @param {Array<Object>} comments - an array of objects representing GitHub comments
*/
function initRenderComments(comments) {
  if (!comments.length) {
    commentsWrapper.innerHTML = `<p>No comments yet 👀 Be the first to post!</p>`;
    return;
  }

  // Load all comment script dependencies async
  Object.keys(commentScripts).forEach(script =>
    loadCommentScript(commentScripts[script], () => renderComments(comments))
  );
}
```

And here's the `loadCommentScript` helper:

{% include codeHeader.html file="_includes/comments.html" %}
```javascript
/**
* @param {Object} script - the script to load async
* @param {function} callback - a function to call once the script has loaded
*/
function loadCommentScript(script, callback) {
  const scriptElement = document.createElement('script');
  scriptElement.src = script.src;
  document.body.appendChild(scriptElement);

  scriptElement.onload = () => {
      script.loaded = true;
      callback();
  };
}
```

It creates a script element and registers an `onload` listener that tags the script object as loaded and invokes a callback. What's that callback? If you look above in `initRenderComments`, we're passing in an arrow function that invokes `renderComments(comments)`:

```javascript
Object.keys(commentScripts).forEach(script =>
  loadCommentScript(commentScripts[script], () => renderComments(comments))
);
```

And that's the last thing we need for our Jekyll comment system to work.

Before we move on, I want to reiterate: If all of this seems weird and hacky, that's because it *technically* is. It *works*, and it *will* defer loading the dependencies until a user has scrolled to the end of the page, which is great. But all of this is much simpler if you're using Webpack to bundle your JavaScript in Jekyll since you can just use dynamic imports and node modules. That's a topic for a different blog post, though. If you *are* using Webpack or some other bundler, I encourage you to take that route—write your comment script in an actual JS file, looking up the issue ID as a `data-` attribute set in your HTML. Then, simply stick the bundled script somewhere in your post layout, and you should be good to go.

### 3. Rendering the Comments

Okay, we've loaded our dependencies dynamically—either using Promises like I showed above or with dynamic imports and a module bundler that can load the chunks at runtime. Either way, our dependencies are now ready to be used, and the only task that remains is actually rendering the comments:

{% include codeHeader.html file="_includes/comments.html" %}
{% raw %}
```javascript
/**
* @param {Array<Object>} comments - an array of objects representing GitHub comments
*/
function renderComments(comments) {
  if (!allCommentScriptsLoaded()) return;

    // load the relativeTime plugin for dayjs so we can express dates relative to now
    dayjs.extend(dayjs_plugin_relativeTime);

    commentsCount.innerText = `(${comments.length})`;

    const commentsList = document.createElement('ol');
    commentsList.className = 'comments-list';
    commentsList.setAttribute('aria-label', 'Comments on this blog post');

    commentsList.innerHTML = comments
    .sort((comment1, comment2) => {
      return comment1.created_at < comment2.created_at ? 1 : -1;
    })
    .map(comment => {
      const datePosted = dayjs(comment.created_at).fromNow();
      const user = comment.user;
      const body = DOMPurify.sanitize(marked(comment.body));
      const postedByAuthor = comment.author_association === 'OWNER';
      const edited = comment.created_at !== comment.updated_at;

      return `<li class="comment">
                  <div class="commenter">
                      <img src="${user.avatar_url}" alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="meta avatar" />
                      <a
                          href="https://github.com/${user.login}"
                          class="meta username"
                          >${user.login}</a
                      >
                      <div class="meta date-posted">commented <time datetime="${comment.created_at}">${datePosted}</time></div>
                      ${postedByAuthor ? '<span class="meta tag author-badge">Author</span>' : ''}
                      ${edited ? `<span class="meta comment-edited">Edited</span>` : ''}
                  </div>
                  <div class="comment-body">${body}</div>
              </li>`;
    })
    .join('');

    commentsWrapper.innerHTML = '';
    commentsWrapper.appendChild(commentsList);
}
```
{% endraw %}

Up at the top of this function, we're using the fail-fast approach and returning if there are some scripts that have not yet loaded. This ensures that all of the remaining code will only get called once all three scripts have loaded.

We're doing several things here, so let's break it all down. For example, this just sets a counter that tells users how many total comments there are:

```javascript
commentsCount.innerText = `(${comments.length})`;
```

The next few lines of code create an ordered list. We sort the comments to show the most recently posted ones first and chain a call to `Array.prototype.map` to create an array of comments, mapping each one to a list item as a template string:

```javascript
const commentsList = document.createElement("ol");
commentsList.className = 'comments-list';
commentsList.setAttribute("aria-label", "Comments on this blog post");

commentsList.innerHTML = comments
  .sort((comment1, comment2) => {
    return comment1.created_at < comment2.created_at ? 1 : -1;
  })
  .map(comment => { ... })
  .join('');
```

This line translates GitHub's markdown for a comment into HTML output:

```javascript
const body = DOMPurify.sanitize(marked(comment.body));
```

We're sanitizing the output HTML per `marked`'s [README suggestion](https://github.com/markedjs/marked#warning--marked-does-not-sanitize-the-output-html-please-use-a-sanitize-library-like-dompurify-recommended-sanitize-html-or-insane-on-the-output-html-):

> Warning: 🚨 Marked does not sanitize the output HTML. Please use a sanitize library, like DOMPurify (recommended), sanitize-html or insane on the output HTML! 🚨

Hopefully the rest of the code is self-explanatory. You can change any of these class names and remove any markup that you don't need for your purposes. For example, these lines are optional:

```javascript
const postedByAuthor = comment.author_association === 'OWNER';
const edited = comment.created_at !== comment.updated_at;
```

I use the first line to make my own comments stand out with an `Author` badge and the second to indicate that a comment has been edited. Neither functionality is super important; it's just there to make this look even more like a true comment system.

And that's it! You can now add comments to your Jekyll blog with relative ease. All that's left now is for you to add your own styling and even rearrange the HTML as you please.
