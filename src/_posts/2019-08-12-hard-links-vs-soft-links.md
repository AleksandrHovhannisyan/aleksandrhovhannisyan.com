You may have heard the terms "hard link" and "soft link" used in the context of Unix and Unix-like operating systems. But do you know what they are and how you create them? In this post, we'll look at the differences between hard links and soft links and understand how to create them.

## Commands We'll Be Using

It helps to know these Unix commands, but if you don't, we'll look at how to use them:

- `touch` and `echo` (+ the output redirection operator `>`) for creating files
- `ls` for listing files in a directory (use `-a` to show all files)
- `cat` for printing the contents of a file
- `stat` for viewing information about a file
- `ln` for creating links (don't worry if you're not familiar with this)
- `readlink` for printing the value of a link (more on that later)

We'll use these to explore hard links and symbolic links in this blog post.

## But First... What Are File Links?

When we talk about files in English, we typically picture a folder, binder, or some other container that directly stores documents or information. But files in the *computer* sense are nothing more than named entries in a directory.

A file does not directly store or point to its data. Instead, a file points to an intermediate data structure in computer memory called an **inode**.

Each file is associated with an inode, and inodes are packed full of rich information about the file's data, including:

- File attributes:
    - size in bytes
    - user/group to which it belongs
    - date created
    - date last modified
    - read/write/execute permissions
- Pointers to blocks on the hard disk containing the raw data.

So you can think of a file system roughly as follows:

```plaintext
Directory --> File (Name) --> Inode --> Raw Data on disk
```

Now, in the simplest terms, **linking** is the process of "referencing" or pointing to an inode in memory. Thus, we say that a **link** is a pointer to an inode. When we create a file for the first time, the name that we assign it becomes the first link to its corresponding inode. Diagrammatically speaking, the link is the arrow between a file and its inode:

```plaintext
File (Name) --> Inode
```

Let's create a file with `echo Hello, links > file` and view information about its inode using the `stat` command:

{% include img.html src: "file.png", alt: "A file created on a Unix operating system" %}

Observe the line that reads `Inode: 4785074605327413`. This is an **inode number**. Each inode has a unique numerical ID associated with it that's generated when the inode is created.

Here's the really interesting bit: *There can be multiple links to a single inode*. The **link count** of an inode tracks the number of files that are pointing to it. Above, we see that the inode associated with `file` has a link count of `1`. This makes sense if you think about it—if creating a file in turn creates an inode somewhere in memory that's associated with the file's data, then surely the inode's initial link count should be `1` and not `0`.

Keep an eye on that `1`—it'll change as we begin experimenting with soft links and hard links.

> **Fun fact 1**: Have you ever heard that "deleting" a file in the traditional sense doesn't imply that the data is irretrievably lost? It's true! In technical terms, a file is considered to have been *truly* deleted when its link count reaches zero. At that point, the space the file occupied is marked as writeable. But until that data is overwritten, computer forensic specialists could potentially recover its contents. To really delete a file, you'd need to [write over it with zeroes](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-write-zero-method-2626052).

> **Fun fact 2**: Directories themselves are special kinds of files—a sort of catalog of files. As it turns out, the starting link count for a new directory is actually `2`, not `1`. This is because **`.`** (which you can observe using `ls -a`) is a reference to the current directory. Thus, there are two references to every new directory: The directory name itself, and then the link **`.`** within that directory. Confused?

## 1. What Are Symbolic Links?

A **symbolic link** (also known as a "soft link" or "symlink") is a file like any other, but its data is special. Whereas regular files can be created at will—initially empty or with some contents—symbolic links cannot be created out of thin air. Rather, to create a symbolic link, you must associate it with some other file. Thus, a symbolic link's raw data is actually the path (relative or absolute) to its target file.

To create a soft link on a Unix system, you use the `ln` (link) command and supply the `-s` flag (for "symbolic"), followed by the original file name and the name of the soft link, in that order:

{% include img.html src: "soft-link.png", alt: "Creating a soft link for a file." %}

Now, let's run the stat command again on both files:

{% include img.html src: "stat-soft-link.png", alt: "Running the stat command on the original file and the soft link" %}

Observe the following:

- The original file (`file`) and the soft link (`softLink`) have different inode numbers. This means that they're actually two different files.
- The original file's link count didn't change. Again, this is because the soft link is an entirely new file that points to a different inode.
- The original file and the soft link have different file sizes. The original file's contents are `Hello, links` (`12` characters). Including the newline character from when we ran `echo`, this constitutes `13` bytes (hence `Size: 13`). As we mentioned above, a soft link's data is the path of the original file. In this case, it's just the string `file`, which has four characters and is therefore four bytes (hence `Size: 4`).

Let's also look at their contents using the `cat` command:

{% include img.html src: "cat-soft-link.png", alt: "Running cat on a soft link" %}

Even though the symbolic link's underlying data is the *path* of the original file, running the cat command effectively *resolves* or *follows* the symbolic link and prints the contents of the original file: `Hello, links` instead of `file`. Naturally, this implies that if the original file's contents change, the result of running `cat softLink` will also change.

> **Exercise 1**: Change the contents of the original file. Note how its size changes, whereas the symbolic link's file size remains the same. However, both print the same text when `cat`-ed.

> **Exercise 2**: Create a file with a longer name. Then, create a symbolic link to that file. Can you determine what the size of the symbolic link will be in bytes?

### Symbolic Links to Files in a Different Directory

Let's see what happens if you create a soft link to a file that's not in the same directory:

{% include img.html src: "soft-link-from-another-dir.png", alt: "Creating a soft link from another directory" %}

This time, the symbolic link's file size is no longer `4` bytes. Rather, it's `10`: the length of the string `links/` (which is `6`) plus the length of the target file name itself (`4`).

### Symbolic Links and Link Rot

Because a symbolic link's data is the *path* to the original file, there are two natural consequences:

- If the original file is renamed or moved to a different directory, the soft link will "break."
- If the original file is deleted, the soft link will "break."

Here's an example showing what happens when we move the original file up one directory:

{% include img.html src: "moved-file.png", alt: "File was moved to a different directory" %}

Notice these two lines:

```plaintext
File: softLink -> file
Size: 4
```

The symbolic link is unaware of the change that occurred! So what happens if we `cat` the two files?

{% include img.html src: "cat-link-rot.png", alt: "Running the cat command after having moved the original file" %}

While the original file's contents are printed just fine, the terminal hints that something is wrong. We can see this with the `ls` command—the soft link's name now appears in red to indicate that it's gone "bad." This is known formally as **link rot**.

Before we move on to discussing hard links, note that there's an additional command you can use: `readlink`. According to the [man page for readlink](https://linux.die.net/man/1/readlink), this command prints the value of the symbolic link, which we know to be the path of the target file. Let's run this on our rotten symlink:

{% include img.html src: "readlink.png", alt: "Running the readlink command" %}

And there's our problem! The symbolic link is still pointing to the original (now non-existent) file.

## 2. What Are Hard Links?

On the other hand, a **hard link** acts as an alias for the target file. It has the same file size and the same inode number but a different name. Creating a hard link for a target file will increment the link count for that file's inode. For these reasons, hard links are also known as **physical links**.

To create a hard link in Linux, we use the `ln` command and supply the `-P` flag (for "physical"):

{% include img.html src: "hard-link.png", alt: "Creating a hard link." %}

Notice that both files are `13` bytes in size, have the same inode number, have the same permissions, and have a link count of `2`. There are two links to the original file's inode: the first one we created, and the hard link we just created manually. In fact, notice that the results of `stat`-ing both the original file and the hard link are identical.

Unlike a soft link, a hard link will not rot if we change the original file's name or move it to a different directory because it points to that file's inode, whereas a soft link references the file's path. It also will not rot if we *delete* the original file. Here's an example of moving the file:

{% include img.html src: "hard-links-dont-rot.png", alt: "Hard links don't rot when the original file is renamed or deleted." %}

Let's delete the target file and `cat` the hard link:

{% include img.html src: "deleting-file.png", alt: "Deleting the original file" %}

Interesting...

If we think back to what "deleting" a file really means, this should make sense: A file is not truly deleted until its corresponding inode's link count reaches zero. In this case, creating a hard link for the file increments its inode's link count to `2`. When we delete the original file, the link count goes down to `1`. Only if we now delete the hard link will the file reach a link count of zero and disappear.

### Limitations of Hard Links

It's worth mentioning that [hard links have two limitations](http://blog.serverbuddies.com/hard-links-have-two-limitations/) that symbolic links do not:

- You cannot create a hard link to a directory, whereas you *can* create a symbolic link to a directory.
- You cannot create a hard link to a file that's on a different volume/disk partition.

It's a tradeoff: While symbolic links do not face these limitations, they are prone to rotting if the original file is renamed, moved, or deleted.

## Hard Links and Symbolic Links to Executable Files

So far, we've looked at creating hard links and soft links to plaintext files. More often, you'll be creating links to executables in Unix.

Recall from before that running `cat` on a soft link or hard link would essentially "follow" that link to the underlying file's inode and print its contents. This isn't behavior unique to the `cat` command, though. If we invoke any other command on a link, or we try to run it as an executable, it'll once again resolve itself to the referenced file.

If you take a look at `/usr/bin/`, you'll find many soft links to executables:

{% include img.html src: "executables.png", alt: "Soft links to Python executables" %}

You can also create a custom link:

{% include img.html src: "python-symlink.png", alt: "Creating a symlink to Python" %}

As expected, invoking the symlink invokes the underlying executable.

## Additional Exercises

Try these out on your end:

1. What do you expect will happen if you change the permissions of a hard link using `chmod`? What about changing the permissions of a soft link?
2. What happens if you create a hard link to a soft link?

Soft links and hard links aren't as mysterious as they may seem at first—they just offer two similar (but notably different) ways to reference files on an operating system.
