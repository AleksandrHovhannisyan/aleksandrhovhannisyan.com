CSS has come a long way since the early days of web development, when tables and various other hacks were used for layout and positioning. Today's developers can enjoy writing CSS that works in all major browsers, without having to bend over backwards to implement tricky layout requirements. Not only does this make it easier to create dynamic layouts, but it also allows you to ship smaller (and simpler) stylesheets by removing unnecessary cruft. In this article, we'll look at various scenarios where modern techniques can reduce the complexity of your code and allow you to write better CSS.

{% include "toc.md" %}

## 1. Chaining Selectors with `:is`

A common task in CSS is to apply some styling to multiple selectors. Perhaps you want to apply the same styling to an element's focus, hover, and ARIA states, like for a navigation link:

```css
.nav-link:focus,
.nav-link:hover,
.nav-link[aria-current="page"] {}
```

For each new selector, you need to repeat the base selector (`.nav-link`). While that may not seem like a big deal in this isolated example, it does add up the more you have to write CSS like this. It's even more verbose if you need to chain additional modifiers, like with `:not`:

```css
.button:not([disabled]):focus,
.button:not([disabled]):hover {}
```

The dev experience is not quite as bad in Sass thanks to the ampersand operator:

```scss
.nav-link {
  &:focus,
  &:hover,
  &[aria-current="page"] {}
}
```

But you still end up shipping the same amount of output CSS. It would be nice if we could cut down on the repetition and only specify the primary selector once. And it turns out that we can!

All major browsers now support the [`:is` pseudo-class function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:is). It accepts a comma-separated list of selectors to match, allowing you to write fewer lines of CSS to accomplish the same task as before.

{% aside %}
  CSS also supports a similar pseudo-class function, `:where`, that also accepts a list of selectors. We'll look at the use cases for `:where` [in the next section](#2-safe-global-defaults-with-where).
{% endaside %}

Here's what our earlier example would look like if we were to use `:is`:

```css
.nav-link:is(:focus, :hover, [aria-current="page"]) {}
```

This selector will match all elements with the `nav-link` class that also have a `:focus` pseudo-class, a `:hover` pseudo-class, or an `aria-current` attribute equal to `"page"`. This allows you to consolidate all of your styling for the element under a single selector.

We can also refactor the second example, where we chained additional modifiers with `:not`:

```css
.button:not([disabled]):is(:focus, :hover) {}
```

This is great because it means that we don't have to repeat any intermediate classes or pseudo-classes—we only need to list them once and chain an `:is` to supply an additional list of selectors to match.

The `:is` pseudo-class function is even nicer in Sass since you don't need to retype the base selector at all and can just leverage the ampersand operator:

```css
.nav-link {
  /* base styling */

  &:is(:focus, :hover, [aria-current="page"]) {
    /* active styling */
  }
}
```

Finally, it's worth noting that while all of the examples so far looked at chaining `:is` to a base selector, you can actually just use `:is` on its own. For example, the following CSS uses `:is` to target the direct descendants of certain parent selectors:

```css
:is(.parent1, .parent2, .parent3) > * {}
```

Without `:is`, you'd end up repeating yourself quite a bit:

```css
.parent1 > *,
.parent2 > *,
.parent3 > * {}
```

### `:is`, Specificity, and Forgiving Selectors

There are two points worth noting about `:is`.

#### Specificity

First, `:is` assumes the highest specificity from among its argument list. This means that it's ideal for situations where all of the selectors you're listing have the same specificity. That's the case in the first example we saw, where all of the selectors share [class specificity](https://web.dev/learn/css/specificity/#class-pseudo-class-or-attribute-selector):

```css
.nav-link:is(:focus, :hover, [aria-current="page"]) {}
```

But in the following toy example, the overall specificity of `:is` ends up being higher due to the presence of an ID in the selector list, so future selectors with lower specificity will be overridden:

```html
<div class="class"></div>
```

```css
div:is(#id, .class) {
  background: red;
}

/* This will always be overridden by the selector above */
div:is(.class, .another-class) {
  background: blue;
}
```

In this example, the div ends up having a background color of `red`, not `blue`, because the ID in the first selector increases the overall specificity of the selector.

#### Forgiving Selector Parsing

Second, `:is` uses [forgiving selector parsing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:is#forgiving_selector_parsing), meaning that if one of the selectors you've listed happens to be invalid, the whole argument list won't be invalidated. Here's an example:

```css
.element:is(:focus, :unrecognized-selector) {}
```

`:is` will still parse the argument list and apply the styling to the element if the valid selector (in this case, `:focus`) is encountered.

## 2. Safe Global Defaults with `:where`

Like `:is`, `:where` is a forgiving pseudo-class function that accepts a comma-separated list of selectors to match. So we could've actually done this in the first example I showed:

```css
.nav-link:where(:focus, :hover, [aria-current="page"]) {}
```

However, those two code samples are not identical. The only difference between `:is` and `:where` is that `:is` assumes the highest specificity from among its selector set, whereas `:where` always resolves to a specificity of zero.

In other words, this:

```css
.nav-link {}
```

Has the same specificity as this:

```css
.nav-link:where(:focus, :hover, [aria-current="page"]) {}
```

{% aside %}
  Both have `10` points of numerical specificity from the base `.nav-link` class. In other words, `:where` does not contribute any additional specificity to the overall selector.
{% endaside %}

Even this complicated and unwieldy selector has a specificity of zero:

```css
:where(#id:not(.very.high.specificity).more.classes) {}
```

This makes `:where` better suited if you want to rely on the cascade for overrides. In fact, one great use case for `:where` is to declare global CSS resets or defaults that are guaranteed to always have the lowest possible specificity (zero). For example, Elad Schechter uses this technique in his [modern CSS reset](https://elad2412.github.io/the-new-css-reset/) to define safe defaults for certain elements. Here's what that might look like in practice:

```css
:where(ul, ol) {
  list-style: none;
}

:where(img) {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}

/* etc */
```

All of the selectors in this stylesheet have a specificity of zero, making it possible to override them with any other valid selector later on (or even earlier in the stylesheet!) without having to artificially increase the specificity of those other selectors.

It's true that you should be declaring your resets first as a best practice anyway, and rarely will you ever want to style elements using just tag names elsewhere in your stylesheet (e.g., if you're using the [BEM methodology](http://getbem.com/introduction/)). But `:where` at least gives you some level of assurance that the styles you've defined are *never* going to run into any specificity conflicts.

Additionally, as Adam Argyle notes in [his article on `:is` and `:where`](https://web.dev/css-is-and-where/), the zero-specificity nature of `:where` could prove useful in CSS libraries, allowing users to override any particular bit of styling from the library with custom CSS.

## 3. RTL Styling with Logical Properties and Values

If your app isn't internationalized and only supports a single locale (like `en-US`), then you probably don't find yourself differentiating between left-to-right (LTR) and right-to-left (RTL) text directionality when writing CSS. So you can safely use properties like `margin-left` and `padding-right`, text alignment values like `left` and `right`, absolute positioning, and so on.

But if your app is internationalized and needs to support multiple locales, then it's a completely different story. In the so-called **RTL locales**—like Arabic, Hebrew, and [various others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-left)—text flows from right to left rather than from left to right. As a rule of thumb, this means that most other visual elements on the page need to mirror themselves and flow in the same direction as the text (although there are rare exceptions to this rule).

The traditional approach to RTL styling is to first write your CSS from an LTR perspective and then scope the RTL styling using the attribute selector and [the `dir` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/dir). This typically involves using **physical properties and values**, which refer to a fixed cardinal direction ("top", "right", "bottom", and "left"). Here's an example of how that might be done:

```css
.element {
  /* LTR CSS */
  margin-left: 8px;
}
html[dir="rtl"] .element {
  /* RTL CSS */
  margin-left: unset;
  margin-right: 8px;
}
```

In LTR mode, our element has a left margin. In RTL mode, it needs to have a right margin. So we unset the left margin and apply the same value as a right margin. This works because the LTR and RTL rulesets are mutually exclusive (and the RTL version has a higher specificity). But this gets very tedious and repetitive the more you have to do it, and you end up having to ship way more CSS than you actually need.

Below are a few more examples of physical properties that you've probably used:

- `margin-[top|right|bottom|left]`
- `padding-[top|right|bottom|left]`
- `border-[top|right|bottom|left]`

However, instead of using physical properties and values, we can take advantage of the fact that CSS also supports **logical properties and values**, which refer to semantic regions—like "start" and "end"—that automatically respect the page's text direction. For example, the following yields the same result as before but with significantly fewer lines of CSS:

```css
.element {
  margin-inline-start: 8px;
}
```

Logical properties typically consist of three parts: the property name (`margin`), the writing mode direction ([`block` vs. `inline`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties#block_vs._inline)), the generic location (`start` or `end`), and the sub-property in question (e.g., `color`, `width`, etc.). So a property like `border-left-color` would become `border-inline-start-color`. In LTR mode, `start` translates to `left`. In RTL mode, it translates to `right`. Both versions of the UI look just as you'd expect them to, but you only need to write a single ruleset to accommodate both.

Of all the recent improvements to CSS, the introduction of logical properties is probably one of my favorites. Even if your app doesn't currently support RTL, you can still use logical properties and values because they work seamlessly for LTR, with the added benefit of future-proofing your app in case you ever *do* internationalize it. There are no downsides to using logical properties; all it requires is a shift in perspective.

You won't appreciate the savings from this kind of a refactor until you have to do it in a large code base. Just this year, I put in a PR at work to use logical properties and values (since our app supports RTL), and I ended up removing nearly **700 net lines** of unnecessary CSS.

### Logical CSS Examples

There are [many logical properties and values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties) that you can use. The following sections list some of the most common and widely available logical CSS properties, as well as how they relate to their physical counterparts. However, it's worth noting that certain physical properties and values do not have logical equivalents. Two examples include transform translations and box shadow offsets.

#### Padding, Margins, Borders

As we saw in an earlier example, you can replace physical margins, padding, and borders with logical properties that automatically respect RTL and vertical writing modes. The following table summarizes some of these naming patterns.

<div class="scroll-x">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">Physical property</th>
        <th scope="col">Logical property</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>[margin|padding|border]-left</code></td>
        <td><code>[margin|padding|border]-inline-start</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>[margin|padding|border]-right</code></td>
        <td><code>[margin|padding|border]-inline-end</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>[margin|padding|border]-top</code></td>
        <td><code>[margin|padding|border]-block-start</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>[margin|padding|border]-bottom</code></td>
        <td><code>[margin|padding|border]-block-end</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>border-bottom-width</code></td>
        <td><code>border-block-end-width</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>border-left-color</code></td>
        <td><code>border-inline-start-color</code></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

If you're listing individual border properties, the logical naming does tend to get verbose. But it's certainly less verbose than having to maintain two sets of styling: one for LTR and another for RTL.

#### Positioning

Absolute, relative, and fixed positioning can also be achieved with logical properties:

<div class="scroll-x">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">Physical property</th>
        <th scope="col">Logical property</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>top</code></td>
        <td><code>inset-block-start</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>bottom</code></td>
        <td><code>inset-block-end</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>left</code></td>
        <td><code>inset-inline-start</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>right</code></td>
        <td><code>inset-inline-end</code></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

#### Width and Height

In case you need to support vertical writing modes, you have the following logical properties:

<div class="scroll-x">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">Physical property</th>
        <th scope="col">Logical property</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>width</code></td>
        <td><code>inline-size</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>height</code></td>
        <td><code>block-size</code></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

Note that this does not affect RTL styling since width is symmetrical. It's just another set of logical properties worth noting.

#### Logical Values

<div class="scroll-x">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">Physical rule</th>
        <th scope="col">Logical rule</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>text-align: right;</code></td>
        <td><code>text-align: end;</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>justify-content: left;</code></td>
        <td><code>justify-content: start;</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>float: left;</code></td>
        <td><code>float: inline-start;</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>float: right;</code></td>
        <td><code>float: inline-end;</code></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

## 4. Writing Fewer Media Queries with Clamp

Another common requirement is to have elements change their styling between two breakpoints, perhaps for font sizing:

```css
.element {
  font-size: 1rem;
}
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  .element {
    font-size: 1.25rem;
  }
}
```

Certain layout changes cannot be achieved without media queries. But for numerical properties—like spacing, font sizing, dimensions, and so on—you may actually want to scale the value linearly between two breakpoints rather than having it jump from one discrete value to another. Fortunately, if you write modern CSS, you can take advantage of [the `clamp` utility function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp()) to declare values that **scale fluidly** between a minimum and a maximum.

### How `clamp` Works

`clamp` is a CSS function that takes three arguments: a minimum value, a preferred value, and a maximum value (in that order):

```css
.element {
  property: clamp(<min>, <preferred>, <max>);
}
```

It attempts to return the preferred value, so long as that value lies between the minimum and maximum. If the preferred value overshoots, `clamp` returns the maximum. If the preferred value undershoots, `clamp` returns the minimum. Hence the name—the preferred value is *clamped* between a ceiling and a floor. Under the hood, this is equivalent to chaining the `min` and `max` functions separately.

At first glance, `clamp` may not seem useful, especially if you consider an example like this:

```css
.element {
  font-size: clamp(12px, 16px, 20px);
}
```

In this case, `clamp` will always return `16px` since that's a static value. Where `clamp` *really* shines is when you give it a **dynamic preferred value**. And one way to do that is to use viewport units (`vw`), where `1vw` is defined to be one percent of the current viewport width. If the viewport is `400px` wide, then `1vw` evaluates to `4px`. The keyword here is "evaluates"—whenever the viewport width changes, the browser needs to recompute the value and resolve it to a CSS pixel. And this is the key ingredient that allows us to replace media queries with [linearly interpolated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation) values.

The best way to understand how this works is to visualize it. Check out Adrian Bece's [Modern Fluid Typography Editor](https://modern-fluid-typography.vercel.app/) to get a better feel for how `clamp` works:

{% include "postImage.html" src: "./images/fluid-typography-editor.jpg", alt: "Adrian Bece's Fluid Typography editor tool. A sidebar contains toggles and inputs for root font size, min size, max size, and fluid size. The main content region shows a plot of the clamping function, which starts at a y-intecept corresponding to the minimum, extends horizontally for a few units, and then scales linearly up to a maximum.", caption: "The leftmost horizontal line represents the minimum value returned by `clamp`; the rightmost horizontal line corresponds to the maximum. Between these two endpoints is the preferred value, which scales upward linearly.", isCaptionAriaHidden: true %}

So, if we set our preferred value in `vw` units, clamp will guarantee that it never falls outside the bounds of the min and max, while the nature of viewport units will allow the value to scale fluidly between those two endpoints. Here's an example:

```css
.element {
  font-size: clamp(1rem, 0.45vw + 0.89rem, 1.25rem);
```

This says:

- The element's font size should be at least `1rem`.
- The element's font size should be at most `1.25rem`.
- The element's preferred font size is `0.45vw + 0.89rem`.

{% aside %}
The preferred value for the code above may seem arbitrary, but it turns out that we can pick the right value [using a bit of math](/blog/fluid-type-scale-with-css-clamp/), given just a min/max font size and a corresponding min/max breakpoint. There are also lots of tools available that can generate a `clamp` declaration for you. One of those is my very own [Fluid Type Scale calculator](https://www.fluid-type-scale.com/), which lets you add fluid font size variables to any project.

{% include "postImage.html" src: "./images/fluid-type-scale.png", alt: "The landing page for the Fluid Type Scale Calculator website features a big bold headline that reads: 'Fluid Type Scale Calculator.' Below is a subtitle that reads: 'Generate font size variables for a fluid type scale. Grab the output CSS and drop it into any existing design system.' Below the header is a two-column layout with a form on the left and some output code on the right showing CSS variables for font sizing." %}
{% endaside %}

Keep in mind that while the examples I showed here are for font sizing, `clamp` can be applied to any numerical properties, including padding, margin, borders, and much more. I encourage you to experiment with `clamp` to see if it's right for your designs.

{% aside %}
  **Note**: While fluid scaling looks great, it may not be the right tool for the job if your design does not account for this behavior. So you may actually want to flip a property between two discrete states rather than allowing it to scale linearly, in which case media queries are your only option. In short, it's important to understand that while `clamp` is useful and has many applications for creating fluidly scaling designs, it's not a drop-in replacement for media queries.
{% endaside %}

## 5. Simplifying Layouts with Gap

Before CSS grid, the only viable option for creating dynamic layouts on the web was Flexbox. But it had one major limitation: lack of support for gaps. Whereas design tools supported the notion of gaps, CSS did not, and most stylesheets relied on margins to space flex children apart. This usually involved inconvenient hacks to exclude the last flex item from the selector list:

```css
.flex-item:not(:last-of-type) {
  margin-right: 8px;
  margin-bottom: 8px;
}
```

But there was no way to exclude the last *row* of the flex layout from getting bottom margins, meaning your flex layout had unnecessary spacing underneath it. Sure, you could offset this with [negative margins at the layout level](https://www.rawkblog.com/2019/01/flexbox-gutters-negative-margins-solved/). But at that point, you end up having to write too much CSS to accomplish such a seemingly simple task.

{% aside %}
  Generally speaking, I also like to avoid using margins at the child level in layouts. The reason for this is that children should not dictate how their siblings are positioned in the layout—that's the layout's job! You can learn more about this in Max Stoiber's article on why [margin is considered harmful](https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/margin/). However, it's worth noting that there are good exceptions to this rule, such as for spacing elements in an article layout. Gaps offer uniform spacing, which is not always what you want.
{% endaside %}

Nowadays, this is no longer an issue because [Flexbox gaps are supported in all major browsers](https://caniuse.com/flexbox-gap). Safari used to be the odd one out and held the web back for a while, but it's supported Flexbox gaps since version 14.1. This means that unless you need to support older browsers, you can easily get away with writing simple and declarative CSS like this:

```css
.flex-layout {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 8px;
}
```

Alternatively, you could use grid, which also supports gaps and auto-wrapping columns:

```css
.grid-layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(some-min, 1fr));
  gap: 8px;
}
```

Either way, you no longer have to worry about the spacing at the edges of the layout—the browser automatically performs these calculations for you and spaces the children accordingly to distribute the gap only between adjacent siblings. If your layout doesn't need to wrap, there won't be any unnecessary spacing along its outer edges. Moreover, since flex and grid layouts automatically flip themselves for RTL, this makes them perfect for creating RTL-safe layouts since you don't have to worry about text directionality.

## 6. Aspect Ratio Sizing with `aspect-ratio`

Let's say you want an element to have square dimensions, like if you're creating the famous [3x3 grid layout](/blog/css-aspect-ratio/#example-3-a-3x3-square-grid-of-images-cropped) for an image gallery.

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); gap: 0.625rem; max-width: 400px;" aria-hidden="true">
  {%- for i in (1..9) -%}
    <div style="background: var(--color-surface-3); aspect-ratio: 1; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">{{ i }}</div>
  {%- endfor -%}
</div>

Prior to the introduction of the CSS `aspect-ratio` property, you'd typically use [the percentage padding trick](/blog/css-aspect-ratio/#approach-2-aspect-ratios-with-percentage-padding) to create responsive squares:

```css
.square {
  height: 0;
  padding-bottom: 100%;
}
```

Alternatively, you could use custom properties to keep the element's width and height in sync. The main disadvantage of this approach is that you cannot use responsive sizing since you're setting explicit dimensions:

```css
.square {
  --size: 2rem;
  width: var(--size);
  height: var(--size);
}
```

But now that [`aspect-ratio` is supported in all major browsers](https://caniuse.com/?search=aspect-ratio), you can use it to express the relationship between an element's width and height much more intuitively:

```css
.square {
  aspect-ratio: 1;
}
```

Maybe you then decide to give the square an explicit width and allow its height to match:

```css
.square {
  aspect-ratio: 1;
  width: 2rem;
}
```

Or maybe it participates in a grid layout and receives its width from the grid formatting context:

```css
.square-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 1rem;
}
.square {
  aspect-ratio: 1;
}
```

Either way, you get a square shape that scales responsively.

{% assign squareDemoMaxWidth = '200px' %}
<div class="flex-center text-center" style="background: var(--color-surface-3); aspect-ratio: 1; max-width: {{ squareDemoMaxWidth }}; padding: var(--size-spacing-5); color: var(--color-text-emphasis);" aria-hidden="true">I'm a square. My max width is {{ squareDemoMaxWidth }}.</div>

One of my favorite things about `aspect-ratio` is how it can be used to compose utility classes with additional properties, like this handy class for circles:

```css
.circle {
  aspect-ratio: 1;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

<div class="circle flex-center text-center" style="background: var(--color-surface-3); max-width: {{ squareDemoMaxWidth }}; padding: var(--size-spacing-5); color: var(--color-text-emphasis);" aria-hidden="true">I'm a circle.</div>

There are many other applications of the `aspect-ratio` property that are worth exploring. One example is to responsively size embedded media, like for YouTube videos. Another is a performance enhancement: `aspect-ratio` plays a key role in preventing layout shifts when you [set a width and height on images](/blog/setting-width-and-height-on-images/) with HTML attributes.

## CSS Is Only Getting Better

While new frameworks and libraries are born every minute, CSS will always be here to stay, and it's only getting better each year. CSS has many promising developments on the horizon, including [leading-trim](https://medium.com/microsoft-design/leading-trim-the-future-of-digital-typesetting-d082d84b202), [container queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Container_Queries), [relative colors](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2021/css-relative-colors/), and many other exciting features. Now is one of the best times to be writing CSS. And the more you learn about the language, the more you'll be able to simplify your styling and write cleaner CSS.
