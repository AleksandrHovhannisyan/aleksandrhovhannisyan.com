      Thanks for dropping by! My name's Aleksandr—and yes, that's spelled <em>without</em> an <code>e</code> between the
      <code>d</code> and the <code>r</code>, pronounced just like Alexander! Don't worry about pronouncing my last name,
      though, unless you enjoy a good challenge.

      Speaking of last names, if mine hasn't already
      <a href="http://www.armeniapedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Last_Names">betrayed me</a>, I was originally born in Armenia, a
      tiny country nestled between Europe, Asia, and
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Ararat">a bunch of biblically old mountains</a>. You can
      <em>almost</em> spot it on a world map if you squint hard enough:

      I've lived in the U.S. for over 15 years now, across three states. I currently reside in Gainesville, Florida, where
      you'll find plenty of friendly gators, lovebugs whose carcasses will eat away at your car's paint, the infamous
      Florida Man, and the

      Professionally, I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for building responsive and accessible user interfaces. I
      enjoy both front-end and back-end work, but I thrive the most in roles that play to my creative strengths and
      problem-solving skills. At work, I enjoy
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyh3C1xDT3Y">cleaning up spaghetti</a>, creating new features, polishing
      UIs, and getting to know my co-workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of work, you'll find me
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp28JPs25ek">praising till I'm hollow</a> and
      <a href="/blog/">writing on this blog</a>. I'm a die-hard
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souls_(series)">Soulsborne</a> fan and love playing video games to relax and
      escape reality \[T]/ I was practically
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhvey_FjtXA">raised by Flash games</a> (may they rest in peace) and an
      unhealthy amount of Old School Runescape, and these experiences with video games have shaped my interests and
      personality to this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaming is just one of the many ways I like to spend my free time. I also find music to be an incredibly
      therapeutic and creative outlet, and that's why I love listening to these awesome people:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lana Del Rey</li>
      <li>Arctic Monkeys</li>
      <li>Godspeed You! Black Emperor</li>
      <li>God Is an Astronaut</li>
      <li>Russian Circles</li>
      <li>... and more!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Of course, there's much more to my life than what I've covered here, but that's about the gist of my background,
      experience, and interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basically, I'm a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DSVDcw6iW8">Real Human Bean</a> who enjoys doing
      <em>real human things</em>&trade;.
