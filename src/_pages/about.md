Thanks for dropping by! My name's Aleksandr—and yes, that's spelled *without* an `e` between the `d` and the `r`, pronounced just like *Alexander*. Don't worry about my last name, though; it's quite long, and most people butcher it anyway.

Speaking of last names, if mine hasn't already [betrayed me](http://www.armeniapedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Last_Names), I was originally born in Armenia, a beautiful country nestled between Europe, Asia, and [a bunch of biblically old mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Ararat). You can almost spot it on a world map if you squint hard enough:

Long story short, I moved to the U.S. when I was little and have lived here for over 15 years now. I currently reside in Gainesville, Florida, where you'll find plenty of friendly gators, lovebugs whose carcasses will eat away at your car's paint, the infamous Florida Man, and, of course, the University of Florida.

Professionally, I work as a software developer and love creating responsive and accessible user experiences on the web. While I enjoy both front-end and back-end work, I tend to thrive in creative roles that play to my visual strengths and problem-solving skills. At work, I enjoy creating user-facing features, polishing UIs, [cleaning up spaghetti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyh3C1xDT3Y), learning new things, and getting to know my co-workers.

I've also worked as a freelance copy editor for over four years now, with my clients ranging from digital marketing agencies to small business owners and companies. Over the years, I've found freelancing to be a great way to market myself and to network with professionals from various industries, all while earning money on the side and honing my writing skills.

Outside of work, you'll find me [writing on my blog](/blog/) and [praising till I'm hollow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp28JPs25ek). I'm a die-hard [Soulsborne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souls_(series)) fan and love playing video games to relax and escape reality. As a kid, I was practically [raised by Flash games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhvey_FjtXA) (may they rest in peace) and an unhealthy amount of Old School Runescape, and these experiences with video games have shaped my interests and personality to this day.

Gaming is just one of the many ways I like to spend my free time. I also find music to be an incredibly therapeutic and creative outlet, and that's why I love listening to these awesome people:

- Lana Del Rey
- Arctic Monkeys
- Godspeed You! Black Emperor
- God Is an Astronaut
- ... and a few others.

There's obviously more to my life than what I feel comfortable sharing here, but that's about the gist of my background and interests. I guess this is also a good spot to leave you with a few of my favorite quotes:

- "If you ride like lightning, you're going to crash like thunder" —*The Place Beyond the Pines*
- "That just sounds like slavery with extra steps" —*Rick and Morty*
- "'Forward' he cried from the rear, and the front rank died" —*Us and Them*, Pink Floyd
- "The smallest coffins are the heaviest" —aphorism, unattributed

At the end of the day, I'm just a [Real Human Bean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DSVDcw6iW8) who enjoys doing real human things.

If that sounds like your cup of tea, go ahead and [get in touch](/contact/)—I'd love to hear from you!
