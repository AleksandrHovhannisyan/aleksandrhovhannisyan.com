Thanks for dropping by! My name's Aleksandr—and yes, that's spelled *without* an `e` between the `d` and the `r`, pronounced just like *Alexander*. Don't worry about my last name, though; it's quite long, and most people butcher it anyway.

Speaking of last names, if mine hasn't already [betrayed me](http://www.armeniapedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Last_Names), I was originally born in Armenia, a beautiful country nestled between Europe, Asia, and [a bunch of biblically old mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Ararat). You can almost spot it on a world map if you squint hard enough:

Long story short, I moved to the U.S. when I was little and have lived here for over 15 years now. I currently reside in Gainesville, Florida, where you'll find plenty of friendly gators, lovebugs whose carcasses will eat away at your car's paint, the infamous Florida Man, and, of course, the University of Florida.

## Work

Professionally, I work as a software engineer and love creating responsive and accessible user experiences on the web. While I'm more than capable of working in a full-stack capacity, I tend to thrive in creative front-end roles that play to my visual strengths and problem-solving skills. At work, I enjoy creating user-facing features, polishing UIs, [cleaning up spaghetti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyh3C1xDT3Y), learning new things, and getting to know my co-workers.

I've also worked as a freelance copy editor for over four years now, with my clients ranging from digital marketing agencies to small business owners and companies. Over the years, I've found freelancing to be a great way to market myself and to network with professionals from various industries, all while earning money on the side and honing my writing skills.

## Hobbies and Interests

Outside of work, you'll find me [writing on my blog](/blog/) and [praising till I'm hollow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp28JPs25ek). I'm a die-hard [Soulsborne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souls_(series)) fan and love playing video games to relax and escape reality. As a kid, I was practically raised by Flash games (may they [rest in peace](/blog/off-topic/rest-in-peace-flash/)) and an unhealthy amount of Old School Runescape, and these experiences with video games have shaped my interests and personality to this day.

Gaming is just one of the many ways I like to spend my free time. I also enjoy listening to music; it's an incredibly therapeutic and creative outlet for me, especially when I'm working. Some of my favorite genres include classic rock, alt and post rock, and indie (if that's even a genre anymore). I especially like music written by Lana Del Rey, Arctic Monkeys, Radiohead, certain songs from Nirvana, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, God Is an Astronaut, Pink Floyd, and a few others.

When I was young, I was absolutely obsessed with drawing (and pretty good at it, too!). As I grew older, though, I found myself preoccupied with so many other things that I simply couldn't find the time to draw. These days, my interest in art has manifested itself in dev work, specifically in front-end development—I love working with colors, fonts, spacing, and all those good things. I've also recently taken an interest in creating [CSS art](/art/) in my free time.

## So, Yeah... That's Me!

Anyway, this is probably a good place to stop. There's obviously more to my life than what I feel comfortable sharing here, but that's about the gist of my background and interests. If you made it this far, cool! Maybe we can chat sometime and get to know each other.

At the end of the day, I'm just a [Real Human Bean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DSVDcw6iW8) who enjoys doing real human things. If that sounds like your cup of tea, go ahead and [get in touch](/contact/)—I'd love to hear from you!
