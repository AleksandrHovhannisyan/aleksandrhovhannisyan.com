    <h4>Fair Use Rationale: Copyrighted Images</h4>
    <p>
        Though any images displayed in this article that were not created by the author himself are subject to copyright, their use is covered by U.S. fair use laws because they are:
        <ul>
            <li>Being used to illustrate the subject in question and not to profit or illegally distribute said materials.</li>
            <li>Of a low resolution, and thus not suitable for production of counterfeit goods.</li>
            <li>Not used in such a way that the reader would be confused into believing that the article is written or authorized by the owner of said images.</li>
            <li>Not replaceable with an uncopyrighted or freely copyrighted image of comparable educational value.</li>
        </ul>
