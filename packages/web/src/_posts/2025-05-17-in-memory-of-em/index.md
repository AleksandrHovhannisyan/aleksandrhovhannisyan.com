Dear Reader,

It pains me to inform you that our beloved Em recently passed away. I apologize for the radio silence on this matter—it all happened so suddenly that I was overcome with grief, and I couldn't find the right words to honor her. But I think I'm ready now.

Those of you who knew Em will recall how she enriched every life she touched, including my own. She had this remarkable ability to bridge gaps and unite people—and, with a dash of her humor, she could even bring us joy in the darkest of times. Oh, how I wish she were here today to lift our spirits.

On this day of mourning, I cannot help but reflect on the fleeting nature of life. One moment we rejoice, and the next we grieve. It's such a cruel fate to know that one's entire existence can be reduced to a beginning and an end—from birth to death, as if marked by a line. It gives one pause.

But let us not linger on the tragedy of Em's passing and instead cherish our memories of her life and all that she did for us. For my part, I will never forget her, and I still sense her presence as though she's right here beside me. I hope—nay, I _know_—that Em is in a better place now. Take comfort in the fact that we, too, will join her someday, once we've served our purpose.

{% details "Confused? Let me clarify." %}
I originally didn't want to include this afterword, but then I remembered [Poe's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe's_law) and realized someone was bound to eventually read this post, take it seriously, and reach out to offer their condolences. If that's you, I have good news: nobody passed away. Well, I suppose someone _somewhere_ did. Quite a lot of people, in fact. At least a few named Em, too, now that I think about it.

No, this Em is [the em dash](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/em-dash-en-dash-how-to-use). Apparently, language models like ChatGPT now love to overuse it—so much so that [it's now widely considered to be a telltale sign of AI writing](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1jhmyd9/how_did_the_em_dash_become_the_signature_ai/), and no amount of prompting seems to convince them to drop the dash. It's gotten so bad that some users have begun [unironcially blocking the em dash on social media](https://x.com/levelsio/status/1913962469774483642) to filter out bot replies, and many tools falsely claim to be able to "detect" AI writing through this and other markers. It's part of a wider trend of AI eroding our trust in online interactions, a topic that on its own deserves an entire essay (or [video essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UShsgCOzER4)).

I must admit that once you see this particular style of AI writing, it's hard to unsee, and every innocent em dash suddenly becomes a suspect. I hope this trend dies off because I don't want to stop using the em dash—it's such a versatile and emphatic piece of punctuation. If anything, I want to double down and use it more liberally. So unless things worsen considerably, you're going to have to pry <kbd>alt+0151</kbd> from my cold, dead hands.
