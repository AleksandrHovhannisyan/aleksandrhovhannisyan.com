Welcome! My name's Aleksandr, pronounced just like _Alexander_. I’m a Texas-based software developer; this is my corner of the web where I write programming tutorials, experiment with web design, and hone my voice as a writer, all to varying degrees of success. Here's a bit more about my experience and interests.

## Work Experience

I've worked as a software engineer at Esri since 2020. I spent the majority of my early years working on [ArcGIS StoryMaps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/) (2020–2024), but I recently joined the Maps SDK team to work on web components that are used throughout the ArcGIS ecosystem.

I specialize in web development and have a deep understanding of web fundamentals, performance testing and optimization, CSS, typography, and accessibility. During my day-to-day work, I mainly use HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, frameworks like React and Svelte, and web components. However, I also have experience with general-purpose programming languages like C++, Lua, and Python, as well as other domain-specific languages such as SQL. I thrive in collaborative environments that encourage growth, offer varied learning opportunities, and cultivate my problem-solving skills and creative strengths.

While the majority of my work experience is in software development, I once worked as a [freelance copy editor](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~014eb3a95d4d1fd855?s=1110580753635725312) for four years during my undergraduate studies, with clients ranging from digital marketing agencies to small business owners and even bigger companies like Quora. Freelancing was a great experience that taught me how to stand out in a fiercely competitive market, helped me grow my professional network, and allowed me to earn a bit of money on the side while in school.

I won't bore you too much with my work history, though; that's what [my LinkedIn]({{ socials.linkedin.url }}) and [résumé](/resume.pdf) are for.

## Hobbies and Interests

### Coding

Even though programming is my full-time job, I still enjoy doing it in my free time and learning new tools, languages, and techniques. I'm always looking for better ways to solve problems, and I often test new things I've learned on this very website. You can explore my coding projects on [my Projects page](/projects/).

### Writing

Outside of work, I enjoy learning new things and [writing on my blog](/blog/). In fact, my passion for writing is what motivated me to create this website—it's a place where I'm free to write to my heart's content, without ads or paywalls. I'm also a big believer in learning by teaching, and my blog allows me to do just that. To date, I've written {{ collections.posts | size }} posts, and I hope to publish many more in the future.

You may have noticed that I like to use [the em dash](/blog/in-memory-of-em/). Rest assured that my content has never been—nor will it _ever_ be—written by AI.

### Music

I've loved listening to music my entire life, but it's only recently that I began _playing_. I picked up my first guitar in December 2023 and taught myself how to play it using online tutorials; since then, it's quickly become one of my favorite hobbies. I've even recorded a few covers:

- [Exit Music (For a Film)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOCRSqz7Bjc)
- [Fake Plastic Trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVTzNm8NVzQ)
- [Pyramid Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF1buO8xsUk)
- [How to Disappear Completely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWkUx5pCCp8)

### Gaming

Like many people, I was first introduced to the world of computers through video games. I often found myself testing the limits of what developers would allow me to get away with in their digital sandboxes, a habit I still haven't shaken to this day (and one that's been surprisingly useful for software testing!). This natural curiosity led me to learn more about computers in high school, write some of my first few lines of code, and, eventually, earn my bachelor's in computer science.

So, when I'm not writing or playing guitar, I'm [praising till I'm hollow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp28JPs25ek). I'm a die-hard [Soulsborne](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souls_(series)>) fan—I love the challenging gameplay, intricate lore, jolly co-operation, and inside jokes that this community is so well known for. But I also enjoy other genres of games: shooters, role-playing games, roguelites, card games, platformers, and more. I was practically raised by a generation of browser Flash games—may they [rest in peace](/blog/rest-in-peace-flash/)—and an unhealthy amount of (Old School) Runescape, and these experiences with video games have shaped my interests and personality. In fact, some games have left such a lasting impression on me that [I've written about them](/tags/gaming/) or [dedicated artwork to them](/art/).

### Reading

Every now and then, I'll dust off a book and do some light reading. I love finding that rare book that captivates me so much that time slips away, where closing it almost feels like waking from a dream. A few of my favorites include:

- _The Little Prince_ by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
- _The Shadow of the Wind_ by Carlos Ruiz Zafón
- _The Count of Monte Cristo_ by Alexandre Dumas
- The Discworld novels by the infinitely witty Terry Pratchett

I don't keep a reading list per se, although there are some books I'd like to one day read... Okay, I guess that's _technically_ a reading list, but hopefully you get my point. I don't like to treat reading as something to check off a list because then it feels like work.

## So, Yeah... That's Me!

If you made it this far, cool! You're still awake!

There's obviously more to my life than what I feel comfortable sharing here, but that's the gist of my background and interests. At the end of the day, I'm just a [Real Human Bean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DSVDcw6iW8) who enjoys doing Real Human Things.
